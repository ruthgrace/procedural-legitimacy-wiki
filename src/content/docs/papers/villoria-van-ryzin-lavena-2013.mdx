**Authors:** Manuel Villoria, Gregg G. Van Ryzin, and Cecilia F. Lavena

**Published:** 2013, *Public Administration Review*, Vol. 73, No. 1, 85–94

**Domain:** Corruption, institutional trust, and social attitudes (Spain)

Corruption does not just erode trust in government — it damages the broader social fabric. Villoria, Van Ryzin, and Lavena use survey data collected during Spain's wave of local and regional corruption scandals to examine how corruption perceptions relate to a wide range of social and political attitudes. They find that citizens who perceive more corruption report lower satisfaction with government and democracy, reduced social and institutional trust, and — critically — **greater willingness to break rules themselves**. This last finding is perhaps the most important: corruption creates a feedback loop in which institutional wrongdoing undermines the normative commitment to rule-following among citizens, potentially breeding further non-compliance.

The study is notable for its breadth of outcomes. Rather than focusing narrowly on political trust, the authors show that corruption perceptions ripple outward to affect general social trust, satisfaction with democratic governance, and attitudes toward personal rule-breaking. This broader damage explains why corruption is so corrosive to procedural legitimacy: it does not just damage the specific institution caught in wrongdoing but degrades the entire normative ecosystem in which fair processes operate.

## Background

The study was conducted during a period of extensive corruption in Spanish local and regional government, primarily associated with the real estate boom of the 2000s. Villoria (Universidad Rey Juan Carlos) and Van Ryzin (Rutgers University) — the latter already known in the procedural legitimacy literature for his work on civil servant trust — along with Lavena (Rutgers University) use data from Spain's Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas surveys. The Spanish context provides an especially strong setting for studying corruption's consequences because the number and visibility of corruption cases created significant variation in citizens' exposure to and perceptions of corruption.

## Key Arguments

| Finding | Detail |
|---|---|
| Corruption reduces government satisfaction | Citizens perceiving more corruption report lower satisfaction with government performance |
| Corruption reduces democratic satisfaction | Perceptions of corruption are associated with lower satisfaction with democracy itself |
| Corruption erodes social trust | Beyond institutional trust, corruption damages general interpersonal trust |
| Corruption increases willingness to break rules | Citizens who perceive more corruption express greater willingness to engage in rule-breaking behavior |
| Feedback loop | Corruption undermines the normative foundations that support compliance, potentially generating more corruption |

## Open Questions

- Does the rule-breaking feedback loop operate through a rational calculation ("everyone is corrupt, so why should I follow the rules?") or through a normative shift (corruption changes what citizens consider acceptable behavior)?
- Can targeted anti-corruption interventions reverse the broader social trust damage, or does that require more systemic institutional reform?
- How do these effects differ across social groups — are younger citizens, lower-income citizens, or citizens with less education more susceptible to the feedback loop?
