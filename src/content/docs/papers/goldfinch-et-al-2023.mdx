What drives trust in local government — good outcomes or fair processes? Goldfinch, Yamamoto, and Aoyagi use citizen survey data from Japanese municipalities to compare three potential drivers: participation (citizen engagement in local decisions), performance (quality of municipal services), and process (perceived fairness of how government makes decisions). The findings show that both service satisfaction and positive process perceptions predict trust, with interaction effects suggesting that process is the stronger antecedent. Citizens who perceive local government decision-making as fair trust their local government more, even controlling for how well services are delivered.

This study is particularly valuable because it tests the process-performance competition directly at the local government level — the level where citizens have the most direct experience with government services and the strongest basis for evaluating both outcomes and procedures. The Japanese municipal context adds cross-cultural evidence to a literature heavily dominated by Western European and North American samples.

The results reinforce Van Ryzin's (2011) finding that process outperforms outcomes as a predictor of trust, but with the added specificity of a local government setting where the relevant processes include city planning consultations, municipal service design, and local policy development.

## Background

The study draws on citizen surveys from Japanese municipalities and uses regression analysis to compare the relative explanatory power of participation, performance, and process perceptions in predicting trust in local government.

## Key Arguments

| Trust Driver | Measure | Effect on Trust in Local Government |
|---|---|---|
| Performance | Satisfaction with municipal service delivery | Positive and significant |
| Process | Perceptions of fair decision-making by local government | Positive, significant, and often stronger than performance |
| Participation | Direct citizen engagement in local decisions | Positive but weaker than process and performance |

## Open Questions

- Does the primacy of process over performance hold during crises (natural disasters, pandemics) where outcomes become existential?
- How do different types of local government processes (zoning hearings vs. budget consultations vs. service interactions) vary in their trust effects?
- Can local governments improve process perceptions without slowing down service delivery?
