**Authors:** Norman Daniels and James Sabin

**Published:** 1997, *Philosophy & Public Affairs*, Vol. 26, No. 4, pp. 303–350

**Domain:** Health care resource allocation and public health administration

Health care systems face an unavoidable legitimacy problem: they must make coverage and rationing decisions that affect people's lives, yet there is no societal consensus on the substantive principles that should guide those decisions. Daniels and Sabin confront this problem head-on by arguing that when substantive agreement is out of reach, legitimacy must instead be secured through fair procedures. Their "accountability for reasonableness" (A4R) framework has become one of the most influential contributions to procedural legitimacy theory outside the criminal justice system.

The A4R framework requires that decision-making processes meet four conditions: publicity (transparent reasoning accessible to the public), relevance (rationales that all fair-minded parties could accept), revisability (mechanisms for appeal and revision in light of new evidence), and enforcement (regulation to ensure the first three conditions are met). The paper argues that these conditions are not merely aspirational — they are necessary for any health care institution to claim legitimate authority over resource allocation. This framework has since been applied far beyond its original context, informing debates about procedural legitimacy in public health agencies, insurance regulation, and government health policy worldwide.

The enduring influence of this paper lies in its demonstration that procedural legitimacy is not a second-best alternative to substantive justice, but a necessary complement to it — particularly in domains where reasonable people disagree about outcomes.

## Background

Daniels and Sabin wrote in the context of 1990s managed care in the United States, where insurers were making consequential coverage decisions with little transparency or accountability. The paper draws on Rawlsian political philosophy, particularly the idea of "reasonable disagreement" about principles of distributive justice.

## Key Arguments

| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| **Publicity condition** | Decisions and their rationales must be publicly accessible |
| **Relevance condition** | Rationales must rest on reasons that fair-minded people can accept as relevant |
| **Revisability condition** | There must be mechanisms for challenge and revision of decisions |
| **Enforcement condition** | Voluntary or regulatory processes must ensure the other conditions are met |

The authors argue that these four conditions, taken together, constitute a procedural solution to the legitimacy deficit in health care rationing. The framework is explicitly designed to operate in the absence of consensus on substantive principles of justice.

## Open Questions

- How well does the A4R framework translate from health care to other domains of government resource allocation?
- Does transparency (publicity) alone generate legitimacy, or must it be paired with genuine influence over outcomes (revisability)?
- Can procedural legitimacy fully compensate for perceived substantive injustice in high-stakes health decisions?
