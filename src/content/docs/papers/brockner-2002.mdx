Brockner's 1996 review (with Wiesenfeld) established that procedural and outcome fairness interact. This 2002 paper refines that finding with a surprising twist: high procedural fairness does not always buffer negative outcomes. It depends on *what you're measuring*. When the dependent variable is employees' support for decisions, decision-makers, or organizations, fair procedures reduce the impact of outcome favorability — the classic "buffering" effect. But when the dependent variable is employees' self-evaluations (self-esteem, perceived competence), fair procedures actually *heighten* the impact of outcomes. A fair process that delivers a negative outcome can make the outcome feel more personally meaningful and harder to dismiss.

This nuance matters for organizational practice. During layoffs, a fair process helps survivors maintain trust in the organization (buffering effect). But for the laid-off employees themselves, a fair process may make the rejection feel more legitimate and therefore more damaging to self-esteem (heightening effect). Organizations need to recognize that the same fair process can have different psychological effects depending on the person's relationship to the outcome.

The paper provides a more complete and realistic picture of procedural justice in organizations than the simple "fair process = good outcomes" narrative.

## Background

The paper is a theoretical refinement of the Brockner and Wiesenfeld (1996) interaction framework, drawing on self-verification theory and attribution theory to explain why the direction of the interaction reverses depending on the type of outcome measured.

## Key Arguments

| Dependent Variable | Effect of High Procedural Fairness |
|---|---|
| Support for decisions/organization | Reduces influence of outcome favorability (buffering) |
| Self-evaluations (self-esteem, competence) | Increases influence of outcome favorability (heightening) |

| Mechanism | Explanation |
|---|---|
| Buffering | Fair process signals the organization is trustworthy despite a bad outcome |
| Heightening | Fair process makes the outcome feel more diagnostic of one's true standing |

## Open Questions

- How should organizations communicate layoff decisions to minimize the heightening effect on self-evaluations?
- Does providing outplacement support or other resources offset the heightening effect?
- Is the heightening effect stronger in cultures with higher emphasis on procedural fairness?
