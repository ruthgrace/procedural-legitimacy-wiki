When governments make unpopular decisions, does it matter which level of government makes them? Alica and Schakel investigate whether locating policy decisions at subnational levels -- municipalities or counties -- increases citizens' willingness to accept those decisions. Using survey-experimental data from 1,855 respondents in the Norwegian Citizen Panel, they present participants with scenarios involving the closure of an educational institution and vary which tier of government is responsible. The core finding is that multilevel involvement in decision-making is generally appreciated by citizens, but its legitimacy-enhancing effect depends heavily on citizens' own preferences for decentralization.

Citizens who prefer subnational authority -- those who believe municipalities and regions should have more autonomous decision-making power -- are significantly more willing to accept decisions made at those levels. Critically, even their acceptance of national-level decisions increases when subnational governments are involved in the process. This suggests that multilevel governance structures can serve as a legitimacy resource, but only for citizens who value decentralization in the first place. Norway provides a "least likely" test case, since it is a unitary state with relatively high trust across all levels of government, making any differences in acceptance harder to detect.

## Background

The study draws on theories of multilevel governance and political legitimacy, connecting the literature on fiscal federalism and regional authority with procedural justice research. The authors distinguish between "self-rule" (authority a government exercises in its own jurisdiction) and "shared-rule" (collaboration between national and subnational tiers), drawing on Hooghe and Marks's Regional Authority Index. The Norwegian context is notable for its relatively high baseline of political trust, which makes this a conservative test of whether multilevel structures generate additional legitimacy. The study also reveals that Norwegian citizens provide less support for county government than for municipal government -- 29.4% want municipalities to have more tasks, versus only 15.1% for counties, and 23.9% prefer counties to be abolished entirely.

## Key Arguments

| Factor | Effect on Decision Acceptance | Condition |
|---|---|---|
| Decision made at municipal level | Higher acceptance among decentralization supporters | Citizens who prefer subnational authority accept local decisions more readily |
| Decision made at national level | Lower acceptance among decentralization supporters | Citizens who value local self-rule are more skeptical of top-down decisions |
| Multilevel involvement (national + subnational) | Increases acceptance, especially among decentralization supporters | Shared-rule moderates resistance to national decisions |
| Citizens with no strong decentralization preference | Minimal difference across levels | Legitimacy gain from multilevel governance is conditional on preferences |

## Open Questions

- Do these findings generalize beyond unitary states like Norway to federal systems where subnational authority is more deeply institutionalized?
- How do citizens with strong decentralization preferences react when subnational involvement is merely consultative rather than decisive?
- Does the legitimacy bonus of multilevel governance erode when citizens perceive subnational involvement as tokenistic?
