Oberfield and Incantalupo provided experimental evidence that bureaucratic discretion produces racial discrimination. Using a randomized audit study, they showed that street-level bureaucrats treated citizens differently based on race — with disparities in responsiveness, helpfulness, and the information provided. Citizens with names signaling Black identity received less favorable treatment than those with names signaling White identity, even when all other aspects of their inquiries were identical.

This finding is important because it demonstrates that discriminatory discretion is not merely a product of individual prejudice but can emerge systematically from the conditions of bureaucratic work. Even among workers who may not consciously intend to discriminate, the combination of time pressure, cognitive shortcuts, and implicit bias produces measurably different outcomes based on race. The experimental design — where the only variable that changed was the racial signal conveyed by the name — provides strong causal evidence that discrimination is occurring.

For procedural legitimacy, this study demonstrates that equal formal rights and identical official procedures do not guarantee equal treatment. The discretionary space within bureaucratic interactions allows implicit biases to produce discriminatory outcomes, undermining the procedural fairness that legitimacy requires. Procedural legitimacy demands not just formally equal rules but substantively equal treatment in how those rules are applied.

## Background

The study used an audit methodology commonly employed in housing and employment discrimination research, adapted for government services. The researchers sent matched inquiries to government offices, varying only the racial signal conveyed by the sender's name. This design isolates the effect of race on bureaucratic responsiveness from confounding factors.

## Key Arguments

| Finding | Significance |
|---|---|
| Racial disparities in bureaucratic responsiveness | Citizens with Black-signaling names received less favorable treatment |
| Systematic, not random | Disparities emerged across multiple offices and contexts |
| Not requiring conscious prejudice | Implicit bias and cognitive shortcuts produce discriminatory discretion |
| Causal evidence | Experimental design establishes discrimination, not just correlation |
| Discretion as mechanism | The discretionary space in bureaucratic work enables discriminatory treatment |

## Open Questions

- What specific mechanisms (implicit bias, stereotyping, in-group favoritism) drive discriminatory discretion?
- Can training interventions reduce discriminatory discretion, or are structural reforms (reducing discretion, blind review) more effective?
- How do discriminatory patterns vary across different types of government services?
