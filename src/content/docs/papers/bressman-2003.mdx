**Domain:** Administrative law, bureaucratic legitimacy, judicial review

Bressman made a foundational argument that arbitrariness — not just accountability — is the core legitimacy problem in administrative law. The traditional focus on whether agencies are accountable to elected officials (through presidential control or congressional oversight) misses a more fundamental question: are agency decisions arbitrary? An agency can be politically accountable and still exercise discretion in ways that are inconsistent, unprincipled, and unfair.

Bressman's framework shifts the legitimacy inquiry from "who controls the agency?" to "are the agency's decisions reasoned and consistent?" This reframing has important implications for how we evaluate bureaucratic discretion. Political accountability — ensuring agencies answer to elected officials — may not prevent arbitrary decision-making if elected officials themselves benefit from or are indifferent to arbitrary agency action. The real legitimacy check, Bressman argues, is whether discretion is exercised through reasoned decision-making with articulated standards.

For procedural legitimacy, Bressman's analysis provides the legal-theoretical foundation for why procedural fairness requires more than democratic accountability. A zoning board elected by the community still exercises illegitimate discretion if its decisions are arbitrary, inconsistent, and unexplained. The procedural legitimacy of bureaucratic action depends on the quality of reasoning, not just the source of authority.

## Background

Bressman is a law professor at Vanderbilt who has written extensively on administrative law and agency decision-making. This article intervened in a long-standing debate in administrative law between proponents of political accountability (who emphasize presidential or congressional control) and proponents of procedural safeguards (who emphasize reasoned decision-making and judicial review).

## Key Arguments

| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| Arbitrariness as core problem | Inconsistent, unprincipled decisions are the primary legitimacy threat |
| Accountability is insufficient | Politically accountable agencies can still act arbitrarily |
| Reasoned decision-making | Legitimacy requires articulated standards and explained decisions |
| Non-delegation concerns | Broad delegations of authority without standards invite arbitrariness |
| Judicial review as check | Courts should focus on whether decisions are reasoned, not just authorized |

## Open Questions

- Can arbitrariness review effectively constrain agency discretion without paralyzing agency action?
- How should courts balance deference to agency expertise with scrutiny of arbitrary decision-making?
- Does Bressman's framework apply to local government discretion, which often lacks the judicial review available at the federal level?
