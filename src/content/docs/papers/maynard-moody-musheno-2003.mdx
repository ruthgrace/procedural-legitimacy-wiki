Maynard-Moody and Musheno provided rich ethnographic evidence of how street-level bureaucrats actually exercise discretion through narrative accounts from police officers, teachers, and vocational rehabilitation counselors. Their central finding challenges both Lipsky's framework and managerial assumptions: frontline workers make decisions based not primarily on formal rules or organizational priorities but on moral judgments about the "worthiness" of the citizens they serve.

Workers routinely distinguish between clients they perceive as deserving and those they view as undeserving, and allocate effort, flexibility, and resources accordingly. A teacher gives extra help to the student they judge to be "really trying." A police officer exercises leniency for the person they see as "basically a good person." A counselor bends rules for the client who "genuinely wants to work." These moral assessments — not organizational rules or managerial directives — are the primary driver of how discretion is exercised at the front lines.

This finding has profound implications for procedural legitimacy. If discretion is exercised based on subjective moral assessments rather than consistent standards, then the procedural fairness of any bureaucratic encounter depends heavily on whether the citizen is judged "worthy" by the particular worker they happen to face. Two citizens with identical cases may receive dramatically different treatment based on the moral narrative the worker constructs about each.

## Background

The study was based on extensive fieldwork and narrative interviews with street-level bureaucrats in Kansas. Maynard-Moody and Musheno used a storytelling methodology, collecting and analyzing the narratives workers told about their most memorable encounters. This approach captured the moral reasoning that formal surveys and experiments miss.

## Key Arguments

| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| Citizen-agent narrative | Workers see themselves as making moral judgments about individual citizens, not applying rules |
| State-agent narrative | The official view that workers implement policy — but workers reject this as primary frame |
| Worthiness judgments | Workers categorize citizens as deserving or undeserving and treat them accordingly |
| Identity-based discretion | Social identity markers (race, class, demeanor) influence worthiness judgments |
| Rule bending vs. breaking | Workers bend rules for "worthy" clients rather than openly defying policy |

## Open Questions

- Can institutional design reduce the influence of worthiness judgments, or are they an inevitable feature of human discretion?
- How do implicit biases interact with explicit moral reasoning in worthiness assessments?
- Would more structured decision frameworks reduce inconsistency while preserving the beneficial flexibility workers exercise for "worthy" clients?
