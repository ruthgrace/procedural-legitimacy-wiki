Can transparency mechanisms create accountability for corruption? Ferraz and Finan exploit a natural experiment in Brazil's anti-corruption program, where the federal government randomly selected municipalities for audit of their use of federal transfers. The audit reports — which documented the extent and nature of corruption — were then publicly released. The authors find that mayors found to be corrupt who were eligible for re-election saw their vote share drop significantly, with the effect reaching roughly a 20 percentage point reduction in electoral support for the most corrupt incumbents. Crucially, the accountability effect was amplified by local media: municipalities with local radio stations showed stronger electoral punishment of corrupt officials, because the audit findings reached a wider audience.

This paper is foundational because it provides clean causal evidence — using the randomization of audits — that transparency mechanisms work. When citizens learn about corruption through credible institutional channels, they act on that information at the ballot box. The finding has influenced both the design of anti-corruption programs and the broader literature on how procedural transparency generates accountability.

## Background

Brazil's Programa de Fiscalização por Sorteios Públicos (Program of Public Lottery Audits), launched in 2003, randomly selected municipalities for audit of their use of federally transferred funds. The audits examined procurement irregularities, ghost employees, diversion of funds, and other forms of corruption. The random selection created ideal conditions for causal identification: municipalities selected for audit before an election are comparable to those selected after, allowing researchers to isolate the effect of information disclosure. Ferraz (University of British Columbia) and Finan (UC Berkeley) matched audit results to electoral outcomes for the 2004 municipal elections, creating one of the cleanest research designs in the corruption literature.

## Key Arguments

| Finding | Detail |
|---|---|
| Audit exposure reduces corrupt incumbents' vote share | Mayors found to be corrupt lost significant electoral support when audit results were released before the election |
| Magnitude of effect | The most corrupt mayors saw roughly 20 percentage point drops in vote share |
| Media amplifies accountability | The electoral punishment was stronger in municipalities with local radio stations, where audit findings reached more voters |
| Clean mayors were rewarded | Mayors whose audits revealed no corruption saw increased electoral support |
| Causal identification | Random selection of municipalities for audit provides strong causal evidence |

## Open Questions

- Does the electoral accountability effect persist in subsequent elections, or do voters' memories of audit findings fade?
- How do corrupt politicians adapt their behavior in response to the threat of audits (e.g., shifting corruption to harder-to-detect forms)?
- Can the Brazilian audit model be exported to other institutional contexts with weaker media or lower civic engagement?
