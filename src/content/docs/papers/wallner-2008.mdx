**Domain:** Education policy / public administration (comparative, Canadian provinces)

Policy scholars have traditionally evaluated public policy along three dimensions: effectiveness, efficiency, and performance. Wallner argues that this framework is incomplete — it misses *legitimacy* as a distinct dimension that determines whether policies are accepted, sustained, and ultimately successful. Through a comparative study of education reform in Alberta and Ontario during the 1990s, she shows that two provinces pursuing broadly similar reform goals achieved radically different outcomes, not because of differences in policy substance, but because of differences in the *process* through which those policies were developed and enacted.

Alberta's education reforms succeeded because the provincial government invested in procedural legitimacy: extensive stakeholder engagement, gradual policy incubation, transparent deliberation, and effective communication of the rationale for change. Ontario's reforms, by contrast, were imposed top-down with minimal stakeholder engagement, poor policy incubation, and weak communicative strategies. The result was widespread resistance, strikes, and ultimate policy failure — despite the reforms being substantively similar to Alberta's.

The paper makes a compelling case that procedural legitimacy is not a luxury or a nice-to-have supplement to good policy design — it is a necessary condition for policy success. Governments that skip the procedural work may find that even well-designed policies fail because they lack the public acceptance needed for implementation.

## Background

Wallner writes from the Canadian public policy tradition and draws on both policy studies and political theory. The Alberta-Ontario comparison is a natural experiment of sorts: similar goals, similar time periods, different procedural approaches, and divergent outcomes.

## Key Arguments

| Province | Procedural Approach | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| Alberta | Extensive stakeholder engagement, transparent deliberation, gradual rollout, strong communication | Reforms accepted and implemented successfully |
| Ontario | Top-down imposition, minimal consultation, rapid timeline, weak communication | Widespread resistance, teacher strikes, policy failure |

| Legitimacy Dimension | Description |
|---|---|
| Stakeholder engagement | Were affected parties given voice in the process? |
| Policy incubation | Was there adequate time for deliberation and refinement? |
| Communicative strategy | Were the rationale and goals of the policy clearly communicated? |
| Emotive appeals | Did the government build public support through persuasive framing? |

## Open Questions

- Is procedural legitimacy always necessary for policy success, or can strong substantive outcomes eventually compensate for procedural deficits?
- How do governments balance the time costs of procedural legitimacy with the political pressure for rapid action?
- Does the importance of procedural legitimacy vary by policy domain (education vs. health care vs. economic policy)?
