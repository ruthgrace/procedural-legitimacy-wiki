**Domain:** Customer product returns and complaint resolution in retail settings

What happens after a customer returns a product? Blodgett, Hill, and Tax used an experimental design with twelve scenarios to test how three dimensions of justice affect customers' repatronage intentions and negative word-of-mouth. The scenarios varied whether the customer received an exchange or partial discount, was treated courteously or rudely, and could resolve the problem promptly or had to return the next day. The results showed that interactional justice — whether the employee was courteous and respectful — had the largest impact on postcomplaint behavior, followed by procedural justice (speed and ease of resolution).

The finding that *how* a return is handled matters more than *what* the customer receives is a direct parallel to the procedural justice findings in organizational and legal settings. A customer who is treated rudely during a return will badmouth the store and never come back, even if they receive a full refund. A customer treated respectfully during a partial resolution may return and stay loyal. For retail managers, the implication is that training frontline employees in respectful interaction is at least as important as having generous return policies.

This was one of the first experimental studies to apply the three-factor justice framework to retail consumer behavior.

## Background

The study uses a factorial vignette experimental design, systematically varying distributive (exchange vs. partial discount), procedural (immediate vs. delayed resolution), and interactional (courteous vs. rude treatment) justice factors across twelve scenarios presented to 265 subjects.

## Key Arguments

| Justice Factor | Manipulation | Effect on Repatronage / Word-of-Mouth |
|---|---|---|
| Interactional (courteous vs. rude) | Employee treatment during return | Largest effect — rude treatment strongly increases negative word-of-mouth |
| Procedural (immediate vs. delayed) | Speed of resolution | Significant effect — delays reduce repatronage intentions |
| Distributive (exchange vs. partial discount) | Outcome of the return | Moderate effect — full exchange preferred but less impactful than treatment |

## Open Questions

- How do online returns (no face-to-face interaction) change the relative importance of the three justice dimensions?
- Does the dominance of interactional justice hold for high-value purchases vs. low-value purchases?
- How do social media reviews change the consequences of postcomplaint injustice for firms?
