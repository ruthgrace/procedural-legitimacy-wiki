**Domain:** Regulation, private governance, algorithmic decision-making, public-private partnerships

Molnar examined how new forms of regulation — particularly the outsourcing of regulatory functions to private actors and the use of algorithmic decision-making — create new forms of discretion that existing accountability mechanisms are poorly equipped to address. In the era of "regulatory capitalism," discretion is exercised not only by government bureaucrats but by private contractors, automated systems, and public-private partnerships that operate outside traditional oversight structures.

This evolution of discretion poses new challenges for procedural legitimacy. When a private company administers a government benefits program, the discretion exercised by its employees is not subject to the same public accountability requirements as government workers. When an algorithm determines eligibility for services, the discretion embedded in its design and training data is invisible to those affected. When a public-private partnership makes land use decisions, the lines of accountability are blurred.

Molnar argues that the existing framework for constraining discretion — developed in the era of direct government provision — needs to be updated to address these new forms. Accountability mechanisms designed for traditional bureaucratic discretion (supervisory oversight, judicial review, public records) are ill-suited to discretion that is exercised by private actors, encoded in algorithms, or distributed across complex institutional arrangements.

## Background

Molnar draws on the concept of "regulatory capitalism" — the observation that modern governance increasingly relies on regulation rather than direct provision, and that this regulatory function is increasingly shared between public and private actors. His analysis examines how this shift creates new forms of discretion that escape existing accountability frameworks.

## Key Arguments

| New Form of Discretion | Accountability Challenge |
|---|---|
| Private contractors | Not subject to public accountability requirements |
| Algorithmic decision-making | Discretion embedded in code and data, invisible to affected parties |
| Public-private partnerships | Blurred lines of authority and responsibility |
| Outsourced regulation | Traditional oversight mechanisms don't reach private actors |
| Distributed discretion | No single point of accountability when decision-making is distributed |

## Open Questions

- Can algorithmic auditing and transparency requirements extend accountability to automated discretion?
- Should private actors exercising public functions be subject to the same accountability standards as government?
- How can citizens challenge discretionary decisions when the decision-maker is an algorithm or private entity?
