Most procedural justice research studies relationships within organizations — between employees and managers, or between workers and the firm. Sapienza and Korsgaard extend the theory to a corporate-financial context: the relationship between entrepreneurs and their venture capital investors. Using both an experiment and a field survey of venture capitalists, they find that timely and candid feedback from entrepreneurs to investors promotes positive relations and trust. But entrepreneurs face a fundamental dilemma: sharing information builds trust (procedural fairness), while withholding information preserves strategic leverage.

This tension between transparency and control is central to many corporate governance relationships — not just venture capital, but also board-management relations, joint ventures, and partnerships. The paper demonstrates that procedural justice theory has explanatory power well beyond the employer-employee context. When one party in a business relationship perceives that the other is being transparent, responsive, and willing to explain decisions, trust grows. When information is hoarded or decisions are made opaquely, trust erodes — even if the underlying business outcomes are positive.

The field survey data from actual venture capitalists adds credibility to findings that could otherwise be dismissed as laboratory artifacts.

## Background

The study bridges the organizational justice literature with the entrepreneurship and venture capital literature. It uses Leventhal's (1980) procedural justice criteria (consistency, bias suppression, accuracy, correctability, representativeness, ethicality) and adapts them to the investor-entrepreneur context.

## Key Arguments

| Entrepreneur Behavior | Effect on Investor Trust |
|---|---|
| Timely feedback and updates | Increases trust and positive relations |
| Candid sharing of negative information | Increases trust (procedural fairness signal) |
| Withholding information | Preserves strategic leverage but erodes trust |
| Explaining reasoning behind decisions | Increases perceived fairness and cooperation |

The core dilemma: **transparency builds trust but gives up leverage; opacity preserves leverage but destroys trust.**

## Open Questions

- How does this dilemma play out in more recent startup-VC dynamics (with board seats, information rights, etc.)?
- Does the procedural justice framework apply to public company governance (shareholder-management relations)?
- How do digital communication tools (investor dashboards, real-time metrics) change the transparency-leverage tradeoff?
