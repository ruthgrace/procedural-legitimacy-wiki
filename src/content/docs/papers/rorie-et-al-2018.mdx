**Domain:** Environmental regulation (corporate compliance with environmental law)

Most procedural justice research studies individuals — citizens interacting with police officers, taxpayers dealing with revenue authorities. Rorie et al. break new ground by asking whether procedural justice theory applies to *corporate* compliance with environmental regulation. Using a factorial survey approach with business professionals, they examine whether perceptions of procedural fairness and legitimacy in regulatory interactions predict corporate compliance with environmental law and, importantly, "beyond-compliance" behavior — voluntary actions that exceed what the law requires.

The authors find support for procedural justice theory in this corporate-regulatory context. How regulators interact with firms — both in direct encounters (inspections, enforcement actions) and indirect signals (perceived fairness of the regulatory regime overall) — shapes compliance decisions. Firms that perceive the regulatory process as fair are not only more likely to comply with minimum standards but also more likely to go beyond what is legally required. This finding has practical significance: if regulators want firms to internalize environmental norms rather than simply game minimum compliance thresholds, procedural fairness in regulatory interactions is a key lever.

This is one of the first empirical tests of procedural justice theory using corporate environmental behavior as an outcome, extending the theory from the individual-citizen level to the organizational level.

## Background

The study draws on Tyler's process-based model of regulation as well as the broader literature on corporate crime and regulatory compliance. Environmental regulation is a particularly interesting test case because firms face complex tradeoffs between compliance costs and the risk of enforcement, making the legitimacy channel especially consequential.

## Key Arguments

| Regulatory Interaction Type | Mechanism | Effect on Compliance |
|---|---|---|
| Direct (inspections, enforcement) | Procedural fairness of the specific encounter | Predicts both compliance and beyond-compliance behavior |
| Indirect (perceived regime fairness) | General perception that the regulatory system is fair | Predicts beyond-compliance behavior |
| Legitimacy | Belief that the regulatory authority has the right to govern | Mediates the effect of procedural justice on behavior |

## Open Questions

- Do these findings generalize to other regulatory domains (financial regulation, occupational safety, food safety)?
- How do firm size and industry affect the sensitivity of compliance behavior to procedural justice?
- Can regulators feasibly redesign inspection and enforcement processes to maximize perceived fairness without compromising deterrence?
