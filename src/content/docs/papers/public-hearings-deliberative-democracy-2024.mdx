**Domain:** Public hearings and deliberative governance (comparative, four international cases)

Public hearings are among the most common forms of citizen participation in government decision-making, yet they are frequently dismissed by deliberative democracy scholars as inadequate -- too brief, too adversarial, too dominated by organized interests. Lightbody challenges this dismissal by developing and applying a systematic evaluation framework, the Democratic Standard Enactment Index (DSEI), to assess whether public hearings actually deliver on core democratic norms. Analyzing four international case studies spanning local to supranational governance levels (2004--2014), she finds that hearings consistently perform at medium-to-high levels across four democratic standards: inclusiveness, popular control, transparency, and considered judgment.

The most striking result is that hearings particularly excel at facilitating considered judgment -- the quality of argumentation and evidence-based reasoning. This challenges the common assumption that hearings are merely performative venues for pre-formed opinions. Lightbody also finds that hearings perform best when they are sequenced and coupled with other democratic processes rather than used in isolation. In one case where a hearing was embedded in a broader participatory sequence, performance across all democratic standards was highest. The implication for local government practice is that public hearings should not be abandoned in favor of newer deliberative formats like mini-publics; instead, they should be strategically positioned within a larger participatory architecture, where their distinctive strengths -- bringing together politicians, experts, interest groups, and citizens in a single forum -- can complement other methods.

## Background

The study introduces the DSEI framework, which consists of twelve evaluative questions organized around four democratic norms drawn from the deliberative democracy literature. Lightbody uses multiple data sources -- including documents, interviews, hearing minutes, media coverage, and government records -- to assess four case studies at varying governance levels. The comparative design allows her to identify which institutional features and contextual conditions enable hearings to perform well on democratic standards. The paper contributes to a growing literature that evaluates existing democratic institutions on their own terms rather than measuring them against idealized deliberative models.

## Key Arguments

| Democratic Standard | Hearing Performance | Key Finding |
|---|---|---|
| Inclusiveness | Medium to high | Hearings bring together diverse stakeholders that mini-publics typically miss |
| Popular control | Medium to high | Depends on formal link between hearing outputs and decision-making authority |
| Transparency | Medium to high | Public nature of hearings inherently supports transparency |
| Considered judgment | Highest performance | Hearings facilitate sophisticated argumentation and evidence-based reasoning |
| Institutional coupling (sequenced with other processes) | Best overall performance | Hearings embedded in broader participatory sequences achieve the strongest results |

## Open Questions

- Can the DSEI framework be adapted to evaluate other common participatory formats (town halls, comment periods, online consultations) on the same democratic standards?
- How do power asymmetries among hearing participants (e.g., well-resourced interest groups versus individual citizens) affect the quality of considered judgment?
- Do public officials who participate in hearings actually change their positions based on the deliberation, or do hearings primarily serve a legitimation function?
