**Domain:** Strike votes during collective bargaining at a North American university

What makes workers vote to strike — and what makes them vote to end one? Cloutier and Denis collected data from a university faculty that went on strike 21 months after the expiration of its collective agreement, tracking justice perceptions across multiple ballot stages. Their key finding is that the drivers of strike votes shift over time. The relative importance of the four justice dimensions (procedural, distributive, interpersonal, informational) and the two sources of injustice (employer and union) varied depending on whether the vote was to initiate, continue, or end the strike.

This dynamic perspective is unusual in the justice literature, which typically treats fairness perceptions as static. Cloutier and Denis show that during a prolonged labor dispute, workers' attention shifts — early on, distributive concerns (the employer's offer) may dominate, while later, procedural and informational concerns (is the union keeping us informed? is the process legitimate?) become more salient. The implication is that both management and union leadership need to attend to different justice dimensions at different stages of a dispute.

For labor relations professionals, the paper offers a roadmap for understanding how justice perceptions evolve during the lifecycle of a labor conflict.

## Background

The study is a longitudinal case study of a university faculty strike in North America, collecting survey data at multiple ballot points. It builds on Cloutier, Denis, and Bilodeau's (2012) eight-dimension model of bargaining fairness.

## Key Arguments

| Ballot Stage | Dominant Justice Concern | Key Source of (In)justice |
|---|---|---|
| Vote to initiate strike | Distributive (employer's offer perceived as unfair) | Employer |
| Vote to continue strike | Informational (is the union keeping us informed?) | Both employer and union |
| Vote to end strike | Procedural and interpersonal (has the process been fair? has treatment been respectful?) | Both employer and union |

## Open Questions

- Do these dynamics generalize to private-sector strikes with different power dynamics?
- How does media coverage during a strike shift the salience of different justice dimensions?
- Can management end strikes faster by strategically addressing the justice dimension most salient at each stage?
