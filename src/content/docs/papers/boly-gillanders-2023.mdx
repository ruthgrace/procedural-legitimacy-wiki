**Authors:** Amadou Boly and Robert Gillanders

**Published:** 2023, Chapter in *The Political Economy of Corruption* (Routledge)

**Domain:** Corruption, institutional trust, and governance reform

Why is corruption so difficult to repair once established? Boly and Gillanders develop a "vicious circle" framework that explains the self-reinforcing relationship between corruption, institutional trust, and legitimacy. Their central argument is that corruption erodes institutional trust, which in turn reduces citizens' willingness to comply with rules and cooperate with government initiatives — including anti-corruption reforms. Because citizens do not trust that reforms are genuine or that new rules will be fairly applied, the reforms fail to gain traction, and the cycle of corruption continues.

This framework has important implications for trust repair after corruption. Even when leaders enact meaningful reforms, the legacy of corruption means that the institutional credibility needed to implement those reforms has already been damaged. Breaking out of the vicious circle requires leaders to demonstrate zero tolerance for corruption through sustained, visible *actions* — not just policies or rhetoric. The framework explains why some reform efforts succeed while others fail: success depends not on the technical quality of the reforms but on whether leaders can credibly signal that the institutional culture has genuinely changed.

## Background

Boly (African Development Bank Group) and Gillanders (Dublin City University) situate their analysis within the broader literature on corruption traps and institutional development. The chapter synthesizes evidence from multiple countries and institutional contexts, drawing on both quantitative studies and case analyses. The vicious circle concept builds on earlier work showing that trust and corruption are jointly determined — corruption causes distrust, and distrust makes corruption harder to address. The authors extend this by focusing specifically on the implications for institutional legitimacy and reform, arguing that the circle can only be broken through credible behavioral change by leaders.

## Key Arguments

| Argument | Detail |
|---|---|
| Vicious circle | Corruption erodes trust, which undermines compliance and reform effectiveness, which perpetuates corruption |
| Trust as prerequisite for reform | Anti-corruption reforms require citizen trust to succeed, but corruption has already destroyed that trust |
| Actions over policies | Breaking the cycle requires leaders to demonstrate zero tolerance through visible behavior, not just formal policy changes |
| Legitimacy deficit compounds | Each iteration of the cycle deepens the legitimacy deficit, making escape progressively harder |
| Explains reform failure | Many well-designed anti-corruption reforms fail because they lack the institutional credibility needed for implementation |

## Open Questions

- What specific leader behaviors are most effective at signaling genuine zero tolerance and breaking the vicious circle?
- Can external actors (international organizations, civil society) substitute for domestic institutional trust in bootstrapping reform credibility?
- Are there threshold effects — a level of corruption beyond which the vicious circle becomes effectively unbreakable without external intervention?
