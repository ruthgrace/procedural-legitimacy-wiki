**Domain:** Local development, zoning, and planning decisions (European case studies)

When a city approves a new development, rezones a neighborhood, or allocates public investment, two justice questions arise simultaneously: Is the *outcome* fair (distributive justice)? And was the *process* fair (procedural justice)? Schmitt and Weck argue that planning scholarship has tended to treat these as separate concerns, but in practice they are deeply intertwined. Drawing on 22 case studies of local development actions across Europe, they develop an analytical framework for understanding how procedural and distributive justice interact in planning practice.

Their key finding is that a "just distribution" and one that is "justly arrived at" are not independent — the process shapes what outcomes are possible, and the anticipated outcomes shape what processes are politically viable. They identify specific factors that promote or inhibit the connection between fair process and fair outcomes, including the strength of participatory mechanisms, the power dynamics between developers and residents, and the transparency of decision criteria.

For local governments, this paper speaks directly to the planning commission hearing, the zoning variance process, and the neighborhood development plan. It suggests that procedural fairness in planning is not just about holding public hearings — it requires attention to who participates, how power is distributed in the process, and whether the process can actually influence the outcome.

## Background

The study is based on research conducted across multiple European cities as part of a comparative planning research project. It draws on planning theory (particularly the communicative planning tradition associated with Healey and Forester) and integrates it with procedural justice theory from social psychology.

## Key Arguments

| Factor | Promotes Justice Link | Inhibits Justice Link |
|---|---|---|
| Participatory mechanisms | Strong community engagement connects fair process to fair outcomes | Tokenistic consultation decouples them |
| Power dynamics | Balanced power between stakeholders | Developer dominance overrides community voice |
| Transparency of criteria | Clear, public decision criteria | Opaque decision-making behind closed doors |
| Institutional capacity | Well-resourced planning departments | Under-resourced offices that can't facilitate meaningful participation |
| Temporal dimension | Adequate time for deliberation | Rush to approve under political pressure |

## Open Questions

- How can local governments ensure that participatory planning processes are genuinely influential rather than performative?
- Do digital engagement tools (online comment portals, virtual hearings) change the procedural-distributive justice relationship?
- How do racial and economic inequalities in participation rates affect whether procedural fairness leads to distributive fairness?
