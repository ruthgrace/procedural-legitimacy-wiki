**Domain:** Meta-analysis of organizational justice across workplace settings

This landmark meta-analysis synthesized 183 studies spanning 25 years of organizational justice research to answer fundamental questions: How large are the effects of different justice dimensions? Do they predict different outcomes? And are they truly distinct constructs? The results confirmed that distributive, procedural, interpersonal, and informational justice each have unique relationships with important workplace outcomes — job satisfaction, organizational commitment, evaluation of authority, organizational citizenship behavior, withdrawal, and performance.

The meta-analysis found that procedural justice is the strongest predictor of organizational-level outcomes (commitment, trust in the organization), while distributive justice is the strongest predictor of outcome-specific satisfaction (pay satisfaction). Interpersonal and informational justice are most strongly linked to evaluations of the specific decision-maker or supervisor. These findings gave organizations clear guidance: if you want commitment and trust, invest in fair processes; if you want outcome satisfaction, ensure distributive fairness; if you want positive supervisor relationships, attend to interpersonal and informational justice.

This remains one of the most cited papers in organizational behavior and is the definitive quantitative summary of the justice-outcome relationship.

## Background

The meta-analysis covers research from the mid-1970s (following Thibaut and Walker's foundational work) through 2000. It includes laboratory experiments, field surveys, and quasi-experimental studies across diverse industries and countries.

## Key Arguments

| Justice Dimension | Strongest Outcome Predicted | Effect Size |
|---|---|---|
| Procedural justice | Organizational commitment, rule compliance, evaluation of authority | Large |
| Distributive justice | Pay satisfaction, outcome satisfaction | Large |
| Interpersonal justice | Evaluation of supervisor, citizenship behavior toward supervisor | Moderate to large |
| Informational justice | Evaluation of supervisor | Moderate |

## Open Questions

- Have the relative effect sizes shifted in the two decades since this meta-analysis was published?
- Do these patterns hold in the gig economy, where organizational attachment is weaker?
- How do justice perceptions aggregate at the team or organizational level (justice climate)?
