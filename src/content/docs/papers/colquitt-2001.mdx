How many kinds of fairness are there in the workplace? Before Colquitt's 2001 paper, researchers disagreed — some argued for two dimensions (distributive and procedural), others for three (adding interactional justice). Colquitt provided definitive empirical evidence for a four-factor structure: distributive justice (fairness of outcomes), procedural justice (fairness of decision-making processes), interpersonal justice (respectful and dignified treatment), and informational justice (adequacy of explanations). Confirmatory factor analyses across two samples supported this structure, and the validated measure became the standard instrument in the field.

The practical significance is that organizations need to attend to all four dimensions independently. A company might have fair pay structures (distributive) and transparent promotion criteria (procedural), but still fail on interpersonal justice if managers treat employees dismissively, or on informational justice if decisions are made without explanation. Each dimension predicts different workplace outcomes — procedural justice is especially linked to evaluations of the organization and its leaders, while interpersonal and informational justice are more strongly linked to supervisor-specific attitudes.

This measure has been used in hundreds of subsequent studies and is the most widely adopted organizational justice scale in management research.

## Background

Colquitt's work builds on Greenberg's (1987, 1993) conceptual distinctions and Bies and Moag's (1986) argument that interactional justice is distinct from procedural justice. The two validation samples came from a university setting and an automobile parts manufacturing company.

## Key Arguments

| Justice Dimension | What It Measures | Key Outcome Predicted |
|---|---|---|
| Distributive | Fairness of pay, rewards, outcomes | Satisfaction with specific outcomes |
| Procedural | Fairness of decision-making processes | Organizational commitment, rule compliance |
| Interpersonal | Respect and dignity in treatment | Evaluation of supervisor |
| Informational | Adequacy and truthfulness of explanations | Trust in decision-makers |

## Open Questions

- Do the four dimensions operate the same way across cultures and national contexts?
- How does algorithmic or AI-driven decision-making affect perceptions across the four dimensions?
- Should additional dimensions be added for emerging workplace contexts (e.g., surveillance fairness, data justice)?
