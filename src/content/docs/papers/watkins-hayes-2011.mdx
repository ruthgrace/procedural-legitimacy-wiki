Watkins-Hayes explored how race shapes the experience of welfare bureaucracy through qualitative research in welfare offices. She showed that racial dynamics permeate bureaucratic encounters in ways that go beyond formal discrimination — affecting the tone of interactions, the amount of information shared, the flexibility offered, and the overall experience of dignity or degradation. Even in offices with racially diverse staff, racial dynamics influenced how clients were treated and how bureaucrats understood their roles.

The study makes a critical contribution by showing that discretion operates not only through formal decisions (approve or deny a claim) but through the interactional quality of bureaucratic encounters. The way a caseworker speaks to a client, whether they explain options or simply issue directives, whether they express empathy or suspicion — all of these interactional dimensions are shaped by racial dynamics and all affect whether citizens experience the bureaucratic encounter as procedurally fair.

For procedural legitimacy, Watkins-Hayes's work connects directly to the procedural justice dimensions of voice, respect, and dignified treatment. If racial dynamics shape whether citizens are treated with respect and given genuine voice, then racial inequality undermines procedural fairness at the most fundamental level — the quality of the human interaction through which government is experienced.

## Background

Watkins-Hayes conducted ethnographic research in welfare offices, combining observations with interviews of both caseworkers and clients. Her research examined how the racial composition of staff, the racial dynamics of worker-client interactions, and the organizational culture of welfare offices shaped the delivery of services.

## Key Arguments

| Finding | Implication |
|---|---|
| Race shapes interactional quality | Tone, respect, information sharing all affected by racial dynamics |
| Beyond formal discrimination | Racial effects extend to how bureaucrats exercise discretion in everyday interactions |
| Dignity and degradation | Bureaucratic encounters can confer or strip dignity along racial lines |
| Representative bureaucracy is insufficient | Diverse staff alone does not eliminate racially inflected discretion |
| Interactional justice matters | Procedural fairness includes how people are treated, not just what decisions are made |

## Open Questions

- Can training on interactional justice reduce racially inflected discretion in bureaucratic encounters?
- How do clients' racial identities interact with bureaucrats' racial identities to shape encounter quality?
- What organizational conditions promote dignified treatment across racial lines?
