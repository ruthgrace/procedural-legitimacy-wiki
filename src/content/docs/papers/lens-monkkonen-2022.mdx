**Authors:** Michael C. Lens and Paavo Monkkonen

**Domain:** Land use regulation, housing policy, urban economics, segregation

Lens and Monkkonen synthesized the interdisciplinary evidence on exclusionary land use regulation, drawing from economics, planning, law, and political science. Their review documented the growing scholarly consensus that local land use regulation constrains housing supply, inflates prices, and contributes to segregation — with discretionary approval processes playing a central role in enabling these outcomes.

The review is valuable for its synthesis across disciplines that often study the same phenomena using different methods and frameworks. Economists emphasize supply constraints and price effects. Planners focus on process design and community outcomes. Legal scholars examine the procedural safeguards (or lack thereof) in zoning decisions. Political scientists study who participates and who benefits. Lens and Monkkonen show that these perspectives converge on a common finding: local land use discretion, as currently exercised, produces exclusionary outcomes.

For procedural legitimacy, this review demonstrates that the exclusionary effects of land use discretion are not contested — the scholarly consensus is clear. The remaining question is not whether discretionary land use processes produce exclusion but how to reform them in ways that preserve meaningful community input while constraining exclusionary outcomes.

## Background

This is a handbook chapter providing a comprehensive review of the literature on exclusionary land use regulation. The authors are urban planning scholars who have published extensively on housing affordability, land use regulation, and their effects on segregation and inequality.

## Key Arguments

| Discipline | Finding |
|---|---|
| Economics | Land use regulation constrains supply and inflates prices |
| Planning | Process design determines who benefits from land use decisions |
| Law | Procedural safeguards in zoning have eroded over time |
| Political science | Participation is dominated by those who benefit from exclusion |
| Consensus | Discretionary land use regulation produces exclusionary outcomes |

## Open Questions

- What regulatory alternatives to discretionary zoning best balance flexibility with equity?
- How do different national contexts shape the relationship between land use regulation and exclusion?
- Can impact assessments or equity analyses be integrated into discretionary land use processes?
