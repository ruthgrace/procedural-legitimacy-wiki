Levi and Sacks offer one of the most ambitious attempts to model the sources of government legitimacy cross-nationally, using Afrobarometer data from multiple African countries. Their central argument is that legitimacy has two key antecedents: government trustworthiness and procedural justice. Citizens who perceive government as both trustworthy and procedurally fair develop what the authors call "value-based legitimacy" — a felt obligation to comply that goes beyond fear of punishment. This value-based legitimacy in turn predicts "behavioral legitimacy" — actual compliance with taxes, laws, and regulations.

The paper is significant for procedural legitimacy research because it tests these mechanisms at the level of entire state institutions rather than individual encounters. Where most procedural justice studies examine specific interactions (a traffic stop, a tax audit), Levi and Sacks ask whether aggregate perceptions of procedural fairness across government institutions predict citizens' general willingness to defer to state authority. Their finding that procedural justice and trustworthiness jointly drive compliance has been influential in political science and development studies.

The cross-national design also pushes the field beyond its heavy reliance on data from wealthy Western democracies, demonstrating that procedural legitimacy dynamics operate in developing-country contexts where state capacity and institutional trust vary widely.

## Background

The study draws on Afrobarometer survey data, which covers citizen attitudes toward government across dozens of African nations. Levi and Sacks situate their work at the intersection of political science (state legitimacy) and social psychology (procedural justice), arguing that these traditions have developed in parallel but need integration.

## Key Arguments

| Concept | Definition | Role in Model |
|---|---|---|
| Government trustworthiness | Belief that government acts in citizens' interests and delivers on commitments | Antecedent of value-based legitimacy |
| Procedural justice | Perception that government processes are fair, transparent, and respectful | Antecedent of value-based legitimacy |
| Value-based legitimacy | Felt moral obligation to comply with government | Mediator between antecedents and behavior |
| Behavioral legitimacy | Actual compliance with laws, taxes, and regulations | Outcome variable |

The model posits that trustworthiness and procedural justice jointly produce value-based legitimacy, which then drives behavioral compliance — a chain that operates across institutional domains and national contexts.

## Open Questions

- How stable are these legitimacy perceptions over time, particularly during political transitions or crises?
- Does the relative importance of trustworthiness versus procedural justice vary across different types of government institutions?
- How do experiences with corruption or state failure affect the capacity of procedural justice to generate legitimacy?
