**Authors:** Kristina Murphy, Tom R. Tyler, and Amy Curtis

**Domain:** Taxation, social security, and law enforcement (cross-context)

A persistent question in procedural justice research is whether fair treatment by authorities can sustain compliance even when people disagree with the law itself. Murphy, Tyler, and Curtis address this directly by examining survey data across three regulatory domains — taxation, social security, and law enforcement — to test whether the legitimacy of the underlying law moderates the effect of procedural justice on compliance. Their finding is striking: procedural justice matters *most* when people question the legitimacy of the laws they are being asked to follow.

This result has significant implications for governance. It suggests that fair procedures are not simply a nice complement to legitimate laws — they are a critical compensating mechanism when laws are contested. In domains where government authority is fragile or disputed (immigration enforcement, tax policy, welfare regulation), procedural fairness may be the primary lever available to sustain voluntary compliance. The cross-context design strengthens this claim by showing the pattern holds across taxation, social security, and policing.

The paper is also notable for being one of the few studies to extend procedural justice research into social security and welfare administration, domains that have received far less attention than policing or tax compliance.

## Background

The study builds on Tyler's (1990, 2006) process-based model of regulation, which argues that legitimacy is the key mechanism through which procedural justice influences compliance. Murphy, Tyler, and Curtis add nuance by distinguishing between legitimacy of the *authority* and legitimacy of the *law*, testing whether these interact differently with procedural justice.

## Key Arguments

| Regulatory Domain | Key Finding |
|---|---|
| Taxation | Procedural justice most effective at promoting compliance when taxpayers question tax law legitimacy |
| Social security | Fair treatment by welfare administrators reduces non-compliance even among those skeptical of welfare rules |
| Law enforcement | Consistent with prior research: procedural justice sustains compliance when law legitimacy is low |
| Cross-context | The moderating effect of law legitimacy on procedural justice is robust across all three domains |

## Open Questions

- If procedural justice compensates for low law legitimacy, is there a threshold below which even fair procedures cannot sustain compliance?
- How do these dynamics play out in domains with highly polarized views on the underlying laws (e.g., immigration, drug regulation)?
- What specific procedural elements are most effective in contexts where law legitimacy is contested?
