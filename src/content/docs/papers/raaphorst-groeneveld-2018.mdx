**Domain:** Street-level bureaucracy, tax enforcement, social categorization

Raaphorst and Groeneveld examined how street-level bureaucrats apply different standards when interacting with citizens from different social groups. Through qualitative research on Dutch tax inspectors, they found that bureaucrats used different "frames" for evaluating compliance depending on the social characteristics of the taxpayer. Citizens from higher-status groups received more favorable assumptions about their intent and compliance, while those from lower-status groups faced greater scrutiny and suspicion.

The study reveals a two-tier system of enforcement created not by formal policy but by the discretionary framing that frontline workers apply. Higher-status taxpayers are more likely to be seen as making honest mistakes, while lower-status taxpayers are more likely to be viewed as potential cheats. These different starting assumptions lead to different levels of scrutiny, different tones of interaction, and ultimately different outcomes — even when the formal rules are identical.

For procedural legitimacy, this research demonstrates that equal rules do not produce equal treatment when discretion allows different frames to be applied to different populations. The procedural fairness citizens experience depends not just on what the rules say but on which assumptions the bureaucrat brings to the encounter — assumptions shaped by social categorization and stereotyping.

## Background

The study used qualitative methods — interviews and observations — with Dutch tax inspectors. The Netherlands provides an interesting context because of its strong administrative law tradition and explicit commitment to equal treatment, making the finding of double standards particularly striking.

## Key Arguments

| Finding | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| Different frames for different groups | Bureaucrats apply different interpretive lenses based on social status |
| Favorable assumptions for high-status citizens | Compliance assumed; mistakes attributed to complexity |
| Suspicion directed at lower-status citizens | Non-compliance suspected; mistakes attributed to intent |
| Two-tier enforcement | Same rules produce different outcomes through different discretionary application |
| Invisible inequality | Double standards operate below the level of formal policy |

## Open Questions

- How conscious are bureaucrats of the different frames they apply to different social groups?
- Can structured decision protocols reduce the influence of social categorization on enforcement decisions?
- Do these patterns hold across different types of government services, or are they specific to enforcement contexts?
