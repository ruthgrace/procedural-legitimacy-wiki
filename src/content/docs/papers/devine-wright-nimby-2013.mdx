**Domain:** Energy infrastructure siting, place attachment, and procedural justice (United Kingdom)

When communities oppose new energy infrastructure, the label "NIMBY" is often applied dismissively -- as if opposition is nothing more than narrow self-interest. Devine-Wright challenges this simplification by investigating the multiple factors that actually drive objections to a proposed high-voltage power line in South West England. Through a survey of 503 residents, the study finds that NIMBY opposition cannot be reduced to any single cause. Instead, objections arise from a combination of personal characteristics, emotional attachments to place, and project-specific factors including perceived impacts, trust in the developer, and -- critically -- perceptions of procedural justice.

The study's central contribution is integrating two previously separate research traditions: one focused on place attachment (the emotional bonds people form with their local environments) and another focused on project-related variables such as trust and procedural fairness. Using hierarchical linear regression, Devine-Wright shows that both pathways matter. Residents who had stronger emotional attachments to their local area were more likely to object to the power line. But project-related factors also played a major independent role: residents who perceived the planning process as procedurally unfair, who distrusted the developer, and who anticipated more negative impacts were significantly more likely to oppose the project. The practical implication is that developers and governments cannot simply overcome opposition through better information campaigns. They must address both the place-based concerns of residents and the procedural dimensions of how the project is planned and communicated. Fair processes and trustworthy engagement are necessary -- though not always sufficient -- conditions for reducing opposition.

## Background

The study was conducted in the context of a proposal to construct a new high-voltage overhead power line in a rural area of South West England. Devine-Wright builds on his earlier theoretical work arguing that NIMBY is better understood as "place-protective action" -- a response triggered when people perceive that a valued place is threatened by unwanted change. The study also draws on the procedural justice literature, which shows that people are more willing to accept unfavorable outcomes when they believe the decision-making process was fair. By combining place attachment theory with procedural justice theory, the research offers a more nuanced framework for understanding infrastructure opposition than the traditional NIMBY label allows.

## Key Arguments

| Predictor Variable | Effect on Opposition | Significance |
|---|---|---|
| Education | Higher education associated with more opposition | Statistically significant |
| Length of residence | Longer residence associated with more opposition | Statistically significant |
| Place attachment (discovered variety) | Stronger attachment to local landscape increases opposition | Statistically significant; place identity matters |
| Perceived negative impacts | Anticipation of harm from the power line increases opposition | Strong positive effect |
| Perceived positive impacts | Recognition of project benefits reduces opposition | Negative effect on opposition |
| Trust in developer | Higher trust reduces opposition | Statistically significant |
| Procedural justice | Perception that the planning process is fair reduces opposition | Statistically significant; independent of place attachment |

## Open Questions

- Can developers meaningfully improve procedural justice perceptions in energy infrastructure siting, or is opposition "locked in" once a project is announced without prior engagement?
- How do place attachment and procedural justice interact over the lifecycle of a project -- does fair process early on reduce the mobilization of place-protective sentiments?
- Do these findings generalize from power lines to other forms of energy infrastructure (wind farms, solar arrays, battery storage) where visual and landscape impacts differ?
