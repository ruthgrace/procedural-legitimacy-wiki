Public administration has long been dominated by a performance-management paradigm: the assumption that citizen trust in government is primarily driven by service outcomes — whether the roads are paved, the trains run on time, the economy grows. Van Ryzin's 2011 study challenges this assumption using International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) data from 33 countries. He finds that process — specifically, perceptions of fairness and equity in how government operates — has a consistently large effect on trust in civil servants, in some models several times larger than the effect of outcomes.

This finding is a direct challenge to the New Public Management orthodoxy that dominated public administration from the 1980s onward. If citizens care more about *how* government treats them than about *what* government delivers, then the relentless focus on performance metrics, efficiency targets, and outcome measurement may be missing the most important driver of public trust. Van Ryzin argues that procedural fairness deserves far more attention in public administration theory and practice.

The cross-national scope of the study — spanning wealthy and developing nations across multiple continents — strengthens the generalizability of the finding and suggests that the primacy of process over outcomes is not a culturally specific phenomenon.

## Background

Van Ryzin situates the study within two competing traditions: the performance-management school (which emphasizes outcomes) and the procedural justice school (which emphasizes process). The ISSP data allow a direct comparison of the relative explanatory power of each.

## Key Arguments

| Factor | Measure | Effect on Trust in Civil Servants |
|---|---|---|
| Government outcomes | Perceptions of service delivery quality | Positive but moderate |
| Government process | Perceptions of fairness and equity | Positive and substantially larger than outcomes |
| Country-level controls | GDP, democracy index, corruption levels | Some variation, but process effect holds across contexts |

The central finding is that process consistently outperforms outcomes as a predictor of trust, suggesting that the legitimacy of government institutions rests more on procedural fairness than on service quality.

## Open Questions

- If process matters more than outcomes, why does public administration still prioritize performance metrics over fairness design?
- How do different dimensions of process (voice, transparency, respect, neutrality) contribute to the overall effect?
- Does the process-outcome balance shift in crisis situations where outcomes become existential (e.g., pandemic response)?
