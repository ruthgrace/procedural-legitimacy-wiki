**Domain:** Cross-national political trust (27 European countries)

Does it matter more that government distributes resources fairly, or that it makes decisions through fair processes? Schnaudt, Hahn, and Heppner tackle this question at scale, analyzing data from over 30,000 respondents across 27 European countries using the European Social Survey and the Varieties of Democracy project. They find that both distributive and procedural justice perceptions significantly predict citizens' political trust, but the effects are not uniform. Procedural justice -- the belief that government processes are fair, impartial, and transparent -- has a particularly strong and consistent relationship with trust in regulatory institutions such as courts, police, and public administrations. Distributive justice -- perceptions about the fairness of outcomes and resource allocation -- matters more for trust in representative institutions like parliaments.

Perhaps the most striking finding is the conditional effect: in countries where adherence to justice principles is systemically compromised, individual-level justice evaluations become *more* influential in shaping trust. Citizens in countries with weak procedural protections are not simply resigned to unfairness; instead, their personal experiences of injustice become even more consequential for how much they trust political institutions. This amplification effect suggests that procedural fairness deficits create a vicious cycle: the worse the system performs on justice, the more each individual's negative experience erodes trust.

## Background

The study combines individual-level survey data (European Social Survey Round 9, 2018) with country-level measures from the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) project to build a multilevel model of justice perceptions and political trust. The authors distinguish between representative institutions (parliament, political parties) and regulatory institutions (courts, police, public administration), arguing that different justice facets should matter differently for each type. The cross-national design allows them to test whether system-level justice conditions moderate the individual-level relationship between justice perceptions and trust.

## Key Arguments

| Justice Dimension | Effect on Trust in Representative Institutions | Effect on Trust in Regulatory Institutions |
|---|---|---|
| Procedural justice (process fairness) | Significant positive effect | Strongest positive effect |
| Distributive justice (outcome fairness) | Strongest positive effect | Significant but weaker effect |
| System-level justice (country adherence to justice norms) | Moderates individual effects | Individual justice perceptions matter more where system-level justice is weak |
| Combined model | Both dimensions independently predict trust | Effects vary by institutional type |

## Open Questions

- Does the amplification effect in low-justice systems also apply at the subnational level -- for instance, do citizens in poorly governed municipalities show even stronger sensitivity to procedural fairness?
- How do media environments and information access shape citizens' perceptions of procedural versus distributive justice?
- Can targeted procedural reforms in specific institutions (e.g., courts) generate spillover trust effects for other institutions?
