**Domain:** Tax authority interactions and compliance (Austria)

Property tax assessments are one of the most common — and most contentious — interactions citizens have with local government. Hartner et al. examine how procedural fairness by tax authorities affects taxpayer compliance, finding that fair treatment and fair decision-making processes matter significantly, particularly for taxpayers who already identify with the broader community and feel a sense of obligation to contribute. When these citizens perceive the tax authority as procedurally unfair — disrespectful, opaque, or inconsistent — they become less willing to comply, even though they accept the underlying obligation to pay taxes.

This finding has a counterintuitive implication for local tax assessors' offices: the taxpayers most likely to be alienated by procedurally unfair treatment are not the chronic evaders but the willing contributors. Citizens who *want* to do the right thing are especially sensitive to how they are treated, because they expect the government to reciprocate their good faith. Heavy-handed collection tactics, unexplained assessment increases, or dismissive responses to appeals can erode compliance precisely among the citizens who were previously most cooperative.

For county and city tax offices, the practical takeaway is that procedural fairness in tax assessment and appeals processes is not just a matter of good governance — it is a compliance strategy. Clear explanations of how assessments are calculated, respectful treatment during appeals, and transparent processes for resolving disputes can sustain the voluntary compliance on which local government revenue depends.

## Background

The study draws on Tyler's procedural justice framework and social identity theory, using survey data from Austrian taxpayers. While the Austrian context involves national taxation, the mechanisms — fairness perceptions, identity, and compliance — apply directly to local property tax systems where citizens interact face-to-face with assessors and appeals boards.

## Key Arguments

| Factor | Effect on Compliance |
|---|---|
| Procedural fairness (respectful treatment, clear processes) | Increases compliance, especially among high-identity taxpayers |
| Procedural unfairness (disrespect, opacity) | Decreases compliance among previously willing contributors |
| National identity / community identification | Moderates the effect — high identifiers are more sensitive to fairness |
| Distributive fairness (perceived fair tax burden) | Independent effect on compliance, but weaker than procedural fairness |

## Open Questions

- How do property tax assessment appeal processes in the US perform on procedural fairness criteria?
- Can local governments increase property tax compliance by improving the transparency and respectfulness of assessment communications?
- Do online property tax portals improve or worsen perceived procedural fairness compared to in-person interactions?
