**Domain:** Local government policy decisions (municipal-level decisions in Sweden)

This paper is an important contrarian voice in the procedural legitimacy literature. Using experimental evidence from Sweden in the context of local policy decisions, Esaiasson et al. argue that democratic governments can achieve surprisingly *little* in terms of decision acceptance through procedural means alone. Their experiments find that outcome favorability — whether the decision goes the way the citizen wanted — is the dominant determinant of decision acceptance. Procedural fairness plays a more limited role than the procedural justice literature typically claims.

This does not mean procedure is irrelevant, but it does add necessary nuance. When citizens strongly oppose a policy outcome (a school closure, a tax increase, a zoning change), fair procedures may soften the blow but cannot transform opposition into acceptance. The paper suggests that the procedural justice literature, which draws heavily from legal and organizational contexts, may overstate the transferability of its findings to democratic political decisions where citizens feel entitled to have their preferred outcome prevail.

For local governments, this is a realistic corrective: fair process matters and should be pursued, but it is not a substitute for substantive responsiveness to citizen preferences. A perfectly fair public hearing that produces an outcome the community hates will still generate backlash.

## Background

The study uses survey experiments with Swedish adults, presenting vignettes about local government decisions (including school closures and infrastructure siting) that vary both the procedural quality and the outcome favorability. The Swedish context is one where trust in government is relatively high, making it a hard test for outcome favorability dominance.

## Key Arguments

| Factor | Effect on Decision Acceptance |
|---|---|
| Outcome favorability (decision matches citizen preference) | Dominant effect — far stronger than procedure |
| Procedural fairness (transparent, participatory process) | Significant but modest — cannot compensate for unfavorable outcomes |
| Interaction | Fair procedures soften the blow of unfavorable outcomes, but the effect is limited |

## Open Questions

- Does the limited effect of procedure hold in contexts where trust in government is lower (e.g., US local government)?
- Are there types of local decisions where procedure matters more (e.g., low-salience issues where people don't have strong outcome preferences)?
- Can repeated fair procedures build a cumulative reservoir of trust that makes unfavorable outcomes more tolerable over time?
