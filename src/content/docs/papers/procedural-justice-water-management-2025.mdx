How is procedural justice understood and applied in the governance of water resources? McKee undertakes a systematic review of the literature to answer this question, examining 28 journal articles published between 2006 and 2025 that engage substantively with procedural justice in water management contexts. The review reveals that while there is growing scholarly attention to procedural justice in water governance, the concept is defined and operationalized in diverse — and sometimes contradictory — ways across disciplines. Some articles treat procedural justice primarily as participation in decision-making, while others emphasize transparency, accountability, or the quality of deliberation. The review maps these differences and identifies areas of overlap and disagreement.

A key insight is that power relations are central to whether procedural justice is achieved in water systems. Formal participatory mechanisms may exist on paper, but they often fail to deliver meaningful procedural justice when power asymmetries between government agencies, private companies, and affected communities are not addressed. The review highlights that marginalized communities — particularly Indigenous peoples, rural populations, and low-income groups — are disproportionately excluded from water governance processes, even when procedural justice is nominally a goal. McKee calls for more attention to the relational dimensions of justice, including who defines the terms of participation and whose knowledge counts in decision-making.

## Background

The review uses a targeted sampling and thematic coding methodology, applying both deductive codes (drawn from established procedural justice theory) and inductive codes (emerging from the water management literature). The 28 articles span multiple disciplines including hydrology, political ecology, environmental studies, law, and public policy. Geographic coverage is broad, with studies from the Global North and Global South, though the review notes that certain regions and water governance contexts remain underrepresented.

## Key Arguments

| Theme | Key Finding |
|---|---|
| Definitional plurality | No single definition of procedural justice dominates; articles draw on different theoretical traditions |
| Participation as core element | Nearly all articles identify public participation as central, but vary in what counts as meaningful participation |
| Power relations | Power asymmetries frequently undermine formal participatory mechanisms |
| Marginalized communities | Indigenous, rural, and low-income groups are disproportionately excluded |
| Related justice dimensions | Procedural justice is often discussed alongside distributional and recognition justice, but the interrelations are undertheorized |
| Temporal scope | Newer articles (post-2015) increasingly emphasize recognition justice and intersectionality alongside procedural justice |

## Open Questions

- How can water governance institutions move beyond formal participation requirements to ensure substantive procedural justice for marginalized communities?
- What metrics or indicators can be used to assess whether procedural justice is actually achieved in water management decisions, rather than merely promised?
- How do different scales of water governance (local, regional, transboundary) affect the feasibility and meaning of procedural justice?
