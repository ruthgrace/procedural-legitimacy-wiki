South Africa's post-apartheid local government system was designed to be participatory and responsive to community needs. Yet decades after democratization, violent service delivery protests remain a persistent feature of municipal governance. Msenge and Nzewi tackle this crisis by proposing an integrated model that links citizen participation to public trust, arguing that the two are inseparable: meaningful participation is a precondition for trust, and without trust, municipalities cannot govern effectively.

The authors trace how the exclusion of communities from municipal decision-making directly undermines trust and escalates tensions. When residents feel that their voices are ignored or that decisions are made without their input, they turn to protest as the only available mechanism for influence. Critically, the study finds that citizens' perception of their ability to influence government decisions may matter more than formal procedural justice alone. It is not enough for municipalities to hold public hearings or follow prescribed consultation procedures -- residents must believe that their input has a genuine chance of shaping outcomes. The proposed model integrates procedural justice components (fair processes, transparent communication, respectful treatment) with substantive citizen influence, arguing that both elements must be present to build the trust necessary to prevent protest and enable effective service delivery. This perspective from the Global South enriches the procedural legitimacy literature by showing how procedural fairness operates in contexts of deep inequality, historical exclusion, and ongoing material deprivation.

## Background

South Africa's Constitution and Municipal Systems Act mandate community participation in local governance. However, implementation has been uneven, with many municipalities treating participation as a compliance exercise rather than a genuine opportunity for citizen input. The country witnessed escalating protest activity through the 2010s -- an average of 8.73 protests per month in 2016, rising to 9.83 in 2017 and 17.75 per month in 2018. Msenge and Nzewi situate their work within the broader literature on procedural justice, trust, and democratic governance, while also drawing on scholarship specific to South African local government. The study highlights how political representation, power struggles, and party affiliations often prevent municipalities from working closely with their communities, turning participation into an empty ritual.

## Key Arguments

| Model Component | Role in Building Trust | Barrier in Practice |
|---|---|---|
| Meaningful participation | Gives communities a genuine voice in decisions | Municipalities treat participation as a compliance checkbox |
| Procedural justice | Fair processes signal that government respects citizens | Political interference and power struggles undermine fairness |
| Transparent communication | Timely information about service delivery reduces uncertainty | Poor communication is a leading cause of protests |
| Perceived influence | Citizens must believe their input can actually change outcomes | Decision-making remains top-down despite formal consultation |
| Interactional justice | Respectful, dignified treatment by officials builds rapport | Officials are often dismissive or inaccessible |
| Trust as outcome | Trust reduces protest behavior and enables cooperative governance | Historical exclusion and ongoing deprivation erode trust |

## Open Questions

- Can the proposed model be operationalized as a practical assessment tool for municipalities seeking to improve citizen trust?
- How do South Africa's findings about participation and trust translate to other Global South contexts with similar patterns of inequality and protest?
- What role do political parties play in mediating (or obstructing) the relationship between citizen participation and public trust at the local level?
