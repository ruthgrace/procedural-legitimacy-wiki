Einstein, Glick, and Palmer provided systematic empirical evidence of who actually participates in local land use decisions. Through analysis of public hearing testimony across Massachusetts communities, they found that participants in land use meetings are overwhelmingly older, whiter, more affluent, and more likely to be homeowners than the broader community. These "neighborhood defenders" consistently oppose new housing development, and their outsized influence in participatory processes produces outcomes that restrict housing supply and exclude newcomers.

The book demonstrates that participatory land use processes have been effectively captured by exclusionary interests. The people who show up to public hearings are not representative of the community — they are a self-selected group with strong economic incentives to oppose development. The participatory process, designed to give the community voice, instead amplifies the voices of those who benefit most from the status quo.

For procedural legitimacy, this work reveals a paradox: more participation does not necessarily mean more procedural fairness. When participatory processes are systematically captured by a narrow, unrepresentative group, the process itself becomes a tool of exclusion. The formal appearance of democratic input masks the substantive reality of exclusionary decision-making.

## Background

The authors compiled the largest dataset of local land use public hearing testimony ever assembled, covering hundreds of meetings across Massachusetts. They combined this with demographic data to compare the characteristics of meeting participants to the broader community population.

## Key Arguments

| Finding | Significance |
|---|---|
| Participants are unrepresentative | Older, whiter, more affluent, more likely homeowners |
| Consistent opposition to development | "Neighborhood defenders" systematically oppose new housing |
| Participation amplifies exclusion | Processes designed for voice instead amplify opposition |
| Housing supply restricted | Participatory capture contributes to housing shortages and high prices |
| Democratic paradox | More participation produces less representative outcomes |

## Open Questions

- What institutional designs could broaden participation in land use decisions beyond "neighborhood defenders"?
- Would as-of-right zoning reforms reduce the influence of participatory capture?
- How do digital participation tools affect who shows up and what outcomes result?
