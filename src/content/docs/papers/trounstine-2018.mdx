Trounstine provides a sweeping historical account of how local land use discretion has enforced segregation in American cities for over a century. She documents how local governments used zoning, infrastructure investment, annexation, and other discretionary tools to create and maintain racially and economically segregated communities. Critically, she shows that these patterns were not accidental or solely the product of private discrimination — they were the deliberate result of public policy choices made through discretionary governmental processes.

The book traces how racial segregation was constructed through a series of discretionary governmental decisions: where to build infrastructure (roads, sewers, parks), how to draw boundaries (school districts, municipal borders), what to zone for (single-family vs. multifamily, residential vs. commercial), and whom to serve with public services. Each of these decisions involved bureaucratic and political discretion, and the cumulative effect was the systematic creation of segregated communities.

For procedural legitimacy, Trounstine's work is devastating. The procedural mechanisms through which segregation was enforced — closed meetings, selective enforcement, manipulation of boundaries, discretionary zoning — represent some of the most consequential procedural legitimacy failures in American governance. These were not aberrations but the routine operation of local government discretion over more than a century.

## Background

Trounstine is a political scientist who combines historical analysis with quantitative data to document patterns of segregation across hundreds of American cities. She draws on census data, land use records, infrastructure investment patterns, and political histories to show how local government discretion systematically produced segregated outcomes.

## Key Arguments

| Mechanism | How It Produced Segregation |
|---|---|
| Zoning | Exclusionary zoning restricted where minorities could live |
| Infrastructure investment | Selective investment created desirable and undesirable areas |
| Annexation | Strategic boundary-drawing excluded minority populations |
| Service provision | Differential public services reinforced area desirability |
| Enforcement discretion | Selective enforcement of codes and standards targeted minority areas |

## Open Questions

- Can contemporary land use reforms undo the legacy of a century of segregation by design?
- How do current discretionary processes continue to reinforce historical patterns of segregation?
- What governance structures best prevent the recurrence of exclusionary land use patterns?
