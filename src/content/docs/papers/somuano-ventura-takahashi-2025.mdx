**Domain:** Institutional trust and democratic governance (Mexico)

Most of what we know about procedural justice and political trust comes from studies of wealthy Western democracies. Does the same logic hold in a country like Mexico, where democratic institutions are younger, corruption is a persistent concern, and citizens have reason to be skeptical of both the process and the outcomes of governance? Somuano Ventura and Takahashi test this question using data from Mexico's 2020 National Survey of Civic Culture (Encuesta Nacional de Cultura Civica), examining what drives citizens' trust in the two institutions elected by popular vote: Congress and the Presidency.

They find that both procedural justice perceptions and perceived representation are positively associated with trust in both institutions, though the magnitudes differ. Citizens who believe that government processes are fair and legal, and who feel that elected officials represent their interests, report higher institutional trust. The finding that procedural justice matters in the Mexican context -- where distrust of institutions is widespread and deeply rooted -- is significant. It suggests that the procedural justice-trust link is not merely an artifact of high-functioning democracies but operates even in settings where the baseline of institutional credibility is low. The study also highlights that representation and procedural justice are conceptually distinct predictors: feeling represented is not the same as feeling that the process is fair, and both independently contribute to trust.

## Background

The study uses data from Mexico's Encuesta Nacional de Cultura Civica (ENCUCI) 2020, a nationally representative survey of civic attitudes. Somuano Ventura, based at El Colegio de Mexico, and Takahashi, based at Waseda University, situate their work at the intersection of procedural justice theory and Latin American political development. The Mexican context is characterized by a long history of single-party dominance (the PRI era), a democratic transition in 2000, and ongoing challenges with corruption, insecurity, and institutional distrust. The study extends the procedural justice literature by applying it to a non-Western democratic context where institutional performance and citizen expectations differ substantially from the European and North American settings that dominate existing research.

## Key Arguments

| Predictor | Effect on Trust in Congress | Effect on Trust in Presidency |
|---|---|---|
| Procedural justice perceptions | Positive and significant | Positive and significant |
| Perceived representation | Positive and significant | Positive and significant |
| Relative magnitude | Both matter; effects differ in size across institutions | Presidency shows somewhat different pattern than Congress |
| Key implication | Procedural fairness and representation are distinct trust drivers | Even in low-trust contexts, fair process perceptions increase institutional trust |

## Open Questions

- How do corruption experiences interact with procedural justice perceptions -- does personal exposure to corruption override the trust-building potential of fair processes?
- Do these findings extend to appointed or non-elected institutions in Mexico (courts, regulatory agencies, police), where the representation dimension is absent?
- How has the politicization of Mexican institutions under recent administrations affected the relationship between procedural perceptions and trust?
