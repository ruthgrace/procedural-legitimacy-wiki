**Domain:** Political corruption and institutional trust (Spain)

Corruption scandals clearly damage public perceptions, but do their effects persist? Solé-Ollé and Sorribas-Navarro exploit a rich dataset of local corruption scandals in Spain between 1999 and 2009 to answer this question. They find an important asymmetry: while corruption *perceptions* gradually recover after a scandal — citizens stop thinking about corruption as a salient local problem — **trust in local politicians remains persistently depressed**. The scandal fades from the headlines, but the damage to the relationship between citizens and their local government endures. This finding directly parallels the broader trust repair literature, which shows that trust destruction is fast while trust repair is slow.

The study is particularly valuable because it uses variation in the timing and location of real corruption cases across Spanish municipalities, allowing the authors to compare affected and unaffected localities over time. The persistent trust deficit they document suggests that corruption is not merely a temporary embarrassment for local government but a structural wound that alters the citizen-government relationship long after the specific scandal has been forgotten.

## Background

The study draws on data from Spanish local governments during a period of extensive corruption linked to the real estate boom. Spain's decentralized governance structure, combined with weak oversight of municipal land-use decisions, created conditions for widespread local corruption — primarily involving kickbacks, irregular zoning permits, and embezzlement of public funds. Solé-Ollé (University of Barcelona) and Sorribas-Navarro (University of Barcelona) use survey data on trust and corruption perceptions matched to a database of documented local corruption cases. Their approach allows them to distinguish between the short-run and long-run effects of corruption exposure on citizen attitudes, addressing a gap in the literature that had largely relied on cross-sectional data unable to capture persistence.

## Key Arguments

| Finding | Detail |
|---|---|
| Corruption perceptions recover | Citizens' sense that corruption is a local problem fades over time after the scandal |
| Trust does not recover | Trust in local politicians remains depressed long after the scandal |
| Asymmetry between perceptions and trust | The scandal's salience fades but its relational damage persists |
| Parallel to trust repair literature | Echoes the broader finding that trust destruction is fast, repair is slow |
| Local-level evidence | Uses municipal-level variation in Spain, providing granular evidence on local trust dynamics |

## Open Questions

- What specific actions by local governments, if any, can accelerate trust recovery after a corruption scandal?
- Does the persistent trust deficit lead to measurable changes in local political behavior (e.g., voter turnout, party switching, protest participation)?
- How does the severity or type of corruption (e.g., petty vs. grand, financial vs. procedural) affect the persistence of trust damage?
