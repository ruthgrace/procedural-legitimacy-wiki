When a customer complains, how the company handles it can matter more than the original problem. Tax, Brown, and Chandrashekaran apply justice theory to customer complaint experiences, demonstrating that customers evaluate complaint interactions along three dimensions: distributive justice (the outcome — was the refund or replacement fair?), procedural justice (the process — was it timely, accessible, and flexible?), and interactional justice (the interpersonal treatment — was the representative respectful and empathetic?). All three dimensions significantly affect customer trust and commitment to the firm.

The findings challenge the common corporate focus on "making it right" through compensation alone. A generous refund delivered through a slow, bureaucratic process by a dismissive representative will not rebuild trust. Conversely, a customer who receives a modest resolution through a quick, respectful process may come away with *increased* loyalty. The paper shows that service recovery is a justice event, and organizations that design their complaint processes with all three justice dimensions in mind can turn failures into relationship-strengthening moments.

For marketing and customer service professionals, this is one of the most cited papers on the justice dimensions of service recovery.

## Background

The study surveyed customers who had filed complaints with firms across multiple industries and measured their justice perceptions, trust, commitment, and behavioral intentions. It draws on organizational justice theory and applies it to the customer-firm relationship.

## Key Arguments

| Justice Dimension | Customer Complaint Example | Effect on Trust/Commitment |
|---|---|---|
| Distributive | Size of refund, quality of replacement | Affects outcome satisfaction |
| Procedural | Speed of resolution, ease of process, flexibility | Affects trust in the firm |
| Interactional | Empathy, courtesy, effort of representative | Affects both trust and commitment |

All three dimensions have significant, independent effects. Interactional justice (how the employee treats the customer) is particularly powerful.

## Open Questions

- How do automated complaint systems (chatbots, self-service portals) affect procedural and interactional justice perceptions?
- Does the relative importance of the three dimensions shift for online vs. in-person complaints?
- Can service recovery produce trust levels *higher* than if the failure had never occurred (the "service recovery paradox")?
