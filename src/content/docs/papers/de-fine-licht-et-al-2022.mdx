**Published:** 2022, *Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory*, Vol. 32, No. 1, pp. 183–198

**Domain:** Municipal school closure decisions (local education governance, Sweden)

Most procedural justice research focuses on what happens *before* a decision is made — was the process transparent? Did affected parties have voice? de Fine Licht, Agerberg, and Esaiasson ask a different question: what happens *after* the decision? Using two survey experiments in the context of local school closures in Sweden, they find that post-decision arrangements — how a decision is announced, explained, and whether affected individuals can voice remaining concerns — have significant legitimacy-enhancing potential. Crucially, this effect holds regardless of the quality of the pre-decision process.

This is a valuable finding for local governments that often face situations where the pre-decision process was imperfect (rushed consultations, incomplete information) but the decision has already been made. The paper suggests that even after a contested decision, local officials can still build legitimacy through how they communicate and implement it. Providing clear explanations, acknowledging the burden on affected parties, and offering channels for ongoing feedback all increase acceptance — even among those directly harmed by the decision.

The school closure context is representative of many difficult local government decisions: closing fire stations, cutting bus routes, denying permits, raising taxes. In each case, what happens after the decision matters for public trust.

## Background

The study uses survey experiments with Swedish adults, presenting vignettes about municipal school closure decisions that vary the quality of pre-decision processes and the presence of post-decision arrangements (explanation, voice opportunities, follow-up support).

## Key Arguments

| Post-Decision Arrangement | Effect on Legitimacy |
|---|---|
| Clear explanation of rationale | Increases acceptance of the decision |
| Opportunity to voice concerns after decision | Increases perceived fairness |
| Follow-up support for affected parties | Increases trust in local government |
| None of the above | Lowest legitimacy, even with fair pre-decision process |

The key finding: **post-decision procedural fairness has independent legitimacy effects**, not just pre-decision fairness.

## Open Questions

- Can post-decision arrangements compensate for a pre-decision process that was clearly unfair or exclusionary?
- How do post-decision arrangements affect long-term trust, not just immediate acceptance?
- Which post-decision arrangements are most effective for different types of local government decisions?
