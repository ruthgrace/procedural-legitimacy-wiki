description: "A Taxonomy of Organizational Justice Theories"

**Authors:** Jerald Greenberg

**Published:** 1987, *Academy of Management Review*, Vol. 12, No. 1, pp. 9–22

**Domain:** Organizational justice theory broadly (workplace settings)

Before Greenberg's 1987 taxonomy, research on fairness in organizations was scattered across disconnected literatures — equity theory, procedural justice, relative deprivation, and others — with little coherent framework linking them. Greenberg proposed a two-dimensional taxonomy that organized these theories along a reactive-proactive dimension (do people respond to existing injustice, or try to create justice proactively?) and a process-content dimension (is the focus on the fairness of procedures or of outcomes?). The result was a four-cell classification that brought order to the field and established "organizational justice" as a unified domain of study.

This paper is foundational because it gave researchers a shared vocabulary and conceptual map. The process-content distinction — separating procedural justice (how decisions are made) from distributive justice (what outcomes result) — became central to all subsequent organizational justice research. The taxonomy also highlighted gaps in the literature, particularly the underdeveloped category of proactive procedural justice: how organizations can design fair processes in advance, rather than simply reacting to perceptions of unfairness.

For corporate contexts, the paper's enduring contribution is the idea that organizations face justice questions on multiple dimensions simultaneously, and that attending to procedure is at least as important as attending to outcomes.

## Background

Greenberg wrote at a time when equity theory (Adams, 1965) dominated thinking about workplace fairness, with its focus almost exclusively on distributive outcomes. The procedural justice tradition initiated by Thibaut and Walker (1975) in legal settings was just beginning to be applied to organizations. Greenberg's taxonomy helped accelerate that application.

## Key Arguments

| Dimension | Reactive | Proactive |
|---|---|---|
| **Content (outcomes)** | Equity theory — people respond to unfair pay or rewards | Allocation preferences — how should rewards be distributed? |
| **Process (procedures)** | Procedural justice — people evaluate the fairness of decision processes | Procedural design — how should organizations build fair processes? |

## Open Questions

- Has the taxonomy held up as the field has added new justice dimensions (interpersonal, informational)?
- Is the proactive-reactive distinction still useful, or has the field moved beyond it?
- How does the taxonomy apply to newer organizational contexts (gig work, remote teams, algorithmic management)?
