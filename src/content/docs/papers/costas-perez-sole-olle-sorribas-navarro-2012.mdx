When a corruption scandal breaks, do voters punish the corrupt politician? The answer, Costas-Pérez, Solé-Ollé, and Sorribas-Navarro show, depends critically on the quality of information and institutional follow-through. Using data on local corruption scandals in Spain, they find that incumbent vote loss can reach 14 percentage points when two conditions are met: the incumbent is formally charged by judicial authorities, and press coverage of the scandal is extensive. However — and this is the crucial finding — when cases are dismissed or fail to lead to judicial action, there is **no measurable electoral punishment**. Similarly, scandals that receive limited media coverage produce minimal accountability.

This finding highlights the role of **information quality and institutional follow-through** in determining whether corruption exposure translates to democratic accountability. Merely uncovering corruption is not enough; the information must be validated by credible institutions (the judiciary) and disseminated widely (the press) for voters to act on it. The paper reveals that accountability is not an automatic consequence of transparency but requires a functioning institutional ecosystem.

## Background

The study uses data on corruption scandals affecting Spanish local governments, combining information on judicial proceedings with media coverage and electoral outcomes. Spain's municipal elections provide a clean setting because local government structures are relatively uniform and electoral data are comprehensive. Costas-Pérez (Barcelona Graduate School of Economics), Solé-Ollé (University of Barcelona), and Sorribas-Navarro (University of Barcelona) construct measures of scandal intensity based on judicial status (investigation, charges, dismissal) and media attention (number of press articles). This allows them to decompose the accountability mechanism into its constituent parts and identify which elements are necessary for electoral consequences.

## Key Arguments

| Finding | Detail |
|---|---|
| Maximum electoral punishment | Incumbent vote loss reaches ~14% when the politician is formally charged and press coverage is extensive |
| Judicial follow-through matters | Cases that are dismissed or do not lead to charges produce no measurable vote loss |
| Media coverage matters | Scandals receiving limited press coverage produce minimal electoral accountability |
| Information quality is key | Voters need both credible validation (judicial action) and widespread dissemination (media) to punish corruption |
| Accountability requires an ecosystem | Transparency alone is insufficient — it must be coupled with institutional follow-through to produce consequences |

## Open Questions

- How do social media and online news sources change the media dissemination channel — does the accountability effect strengthen or weaken when information spreads through less curated channels?
- Do voters distinguish between different types of corruption (e.g., personal enrichment vs. party financing) in their electoral responses?
- In contexts with weaker judicial independence, does the absence of credible judicial follow-through permanently block electoral accountability?
