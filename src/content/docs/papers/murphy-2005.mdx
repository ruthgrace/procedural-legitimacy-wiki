Tax compliance is one of the most consequential areas where government depends on voluntary cooperation from citizens. Murphy's 2005 study is among the first to rigorously apply procedural justice theory — long studied in policing and courts — to the domain of tax administration. Using survey data from Australians who had been subject to enforcement action by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), she demonstrates that perceptions of procedural fairness strongly predict whether taxpayers view the ATO as a legitimate authority, which in turn shapes their willingness to comply.

The central finding is that heavy-handed, punishment-first enforcement strategies can backfire. When taxpayers perceive their treatment as procedurally unfair — lacking in respect, voice, or neutrality — they are more likely to view the tax authority as illegitimate and to resist compliance. This creates a paradox for regulators: the very tools designed to compel compliance can undermine the legitimacy needed to sustain it. Murphy argues that regulators should adopt a "responsive regulation" approach, escalating enforcement only when cooperative strategies fail.

This paper is significant because it demonstrated that the mechanisms identified by Tyler and others in criminal justice — voice, respect, neutrality, trustworthiness — operate similarly in the regulatory context. It helped establish tax compliance as a major empirical domain for procedural legitimacy research.

## Background

The study builds on Tom Tyler's foundational work on procedural justice and legitimacy, as well as Braithwaite's responsive regulation framework. The Australian Taxation Office had undertaken a major enforcement campaign in the early 2000s, providing a natural setting for studying how regulatory encounters shape legitimacy perceptions.

## Key Arguments

| Argument | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Procedural justice predicts perceived legitimacy of the ATO | Survey data shows strong statistical relationship between fairness perceptions and legitimacy ratings |
| Legitimacy mediates the relationship between procedural justice and compliance | Path analysis confirms indirect effect through legitimacy |
| Punishment-first strategies undermine legitimacy | Taxpayers subjected to harsh enforcement without voice report lower legitimacy perceptions |
| Responsive regulation is more effective than deterrence alone | Data suggests graduated enforcement better sustains compliance over time |

## Open Questions

- Does the relationship between procedural justice and tax compliance hold across different national and cultural contexts?
- How do digital and automated tax processes affect perceptions of procedural fairness?
- Can procedural justice principles be effectively built into large-scale bureaucratic enforcement systems?
