**Domain:** Employee-customer interface in corporate complaint handling

This paper makes a connection that most organizational justice research misses: internal fairness (how a company treats its employees) cascades outward to affect external fairness (how customers experience complaint handling). Maxham and Netemeyer find that when employees perceive shared values and organizational justice within their firm, they are more likely to engage in customer-directed extra-role behaviors during complaint interactions — going above and beyond the minimum required. These behaviors in turn affect customers' own perceptions of justice, satisfaction, word of mouth, and purchase intent.

The practical implication is that organizational justice is not just an internal HR concern — it is a customer-facing strategy. Companies that treat their employees fairly produce employees who treat customers fairly. Companies with toxic internal cultures produce frontline workers who deliver poor complaint experiences, regardless of the firm's official service recovery policies. The paper demonstrates an empirical chain from internal justice climate to employee behavior to customer outcomes.

This is one of the few studies to trace the justice cascade from inside the organization to the customer interface, making it relevant to both HR and marketing professionals.

## Background

The study combines employee surveys (measuring perceived organizational justice and shared values) with matched customer surveys (measuring justice perceptions, satisfaction, and behavioral intentions) in a service firm, creating a multilevel dataset that links internal and external perceptions.

## Key Arguments

| Chain Link | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| Internal organizational justice | Employees who feel fairly treated are more engaged |
| Shared values | Alignment between employee and firm values reinforces extra-role behavior |
| Employee extra-role behavior | Employees go beyond minimum requirements during complaint handling |
| Customer justice perceptions | Customers perceive the complaint interaction as fairer |
| Customer outcomes | Higher satisfaction, positive word-of-mouth, repurchase intent |

The key insight: **internal fairness produces external fairness.** The justice climate inside the company is visible to customers.

## Open Questions

- How strong is this cascade effect in firms with high employee turnover (retail, fast food)?
- Can training compensate for a poor internal justice climate, or does authentic fairness require systemic change?
- Do customers perceive the difference between genuine extra-role behavior and scripted service recovery?
