When a city government asks residents to participate in the budget process, does the experience of being heard shape how citizens evaluate their local government? Herian et al. test this question through a survey experiment focused on local government budgeting in Lincoln, Nebraska. They find that when government uses public input in its decision-making, citizens perceive the process as fairer — and those fairness perceptions in turn improve their evaluations of local government overall. This is one of the few studies to directly measure the link between participation, procedural fairness, and legitimacy at the municipal level.

The study adds an important wrinkle by drawing on the uncertainty management model from social psychology. Citizens who are more uncertain about their local government — who don't know much about how it operates or whether it can be trusted — are *more* affected by procedural fairness cues. This means that procedural fairness matters most precisely where government credibility is lowest. For city and county governments trying to build trust with disengaged or skeptical residents, the implication is clear: opening up genuinely participatory processes can have outsized legitimacy benefits.

The Lincoln, Nebraska setting makes this study particularly relevant for understanding how mid-sized American cities can use participatory processes to strengthen democratic legitimacy, especially around contentious budget decisions.

## Background

The study builds on Tyler's procedural justice framework and the uncertainty management model developed by Van den Bos and Lind (2002). The authors designed a survey experiment in which Lincoln residents read vignettes about city budget decisions that varied in their level of public participation, then rated the fairness of the process and their overall evaluation of local government.

## Key Arguments

| Experimental Condition | Effect on Procedural Fairness | Effect on Government Evaluation |
|---|---|---|
| High public participation | Higher fairness ratings | More positive evaluations |
| Low public participation | Lower fairness ratings | More negative evaluations |
| High citizen uncertainty | Fairness perceptions have stronger effect on evaluations | Procedural justice matters most here |
| Low citizen uncertainty | Fairness perceptions matter less | Citizens rely more on prior attitudes |

## Open Questions

- Do these effects hold for other types of local government decisions beyond budgeting (e.g., zoning, permitting)?
- How much participation is enough? Is there a threshold below which participation feels tokenistic and backfires?
- Do online and digital participation formats generate the same procedural fairness perceptions as in-person hearings?
