**Domain:** Public participation in local government planning (global systematic review)

What has a decade of research taught us about how citizens participate in local government planning decisions? Abas and colleagues conduct a systematic review of 69 studies published between 2012 and 2022, covering 39 countries across five continents. Following PRISMA guidelines and searching Web of Science and Scopus, they identify three main types of public participation in local authority planning: access to information, consultation, and active participation. The review reveals both progress and persistent challenges. While participatory mechanisms have expanded globally, significant gaps remain -- particularly for non-urban communities such as villages, coastal areas, island communities, and indigenous populations, who are disproportionately affected by local planning decisions but systematically underrepresented in participatory processes.

The review's most sobering finding concerns the gap between institutional rhetoric and practice. While governments increasingly endorse public participation as a principle, institutional stakeholders often perceive civic involvement primarily as a source of risk rather than benefit. Citizens themselves, by contrast, see untapped potential for creative input, deliberation, and collaborative planning. This asymmetry in perception helps explain why many participation exercises remain superficial: they are designed to manage rather than empower, satisfying a procedural requirement without generating genuine deliberative engagement. For procedural legitimacy, the implication is clear -- participation that is tokenistic not only fails to build trust but may actively undermine it by raising and then frustrating citizen expectations.

## Background

The study uses the PRISMA systematic review methodology, searching Web of Science and Scopus databases and screening results through a multi-stage process. The authors categorize participation along a spectrum from passive (access to information) through intermediate (consultation) to active (genuine co-decision-making), echoing Arnstein's classic ladder of participation. The global scope of the review allows comparison across governance systems, development levels, and cultural contexts, revealing that participation challenges are remarkably consistent worldwide despite institutional variation.

## Key Arguments

| Participation Type | Definition | Prevalence in Literature |
|---|---|---|
| Access to information | Citizens receive planning information from authorities | Common but insufficient on its own |
| Consultation | Citizens provide feedback on proposals; authorities retain decision power | Most frequently studied form |
| Active participation | Citizens co-create plans and share decision-making authority | Least common; most impactful for legitimacy |
| Key gap: non-urban communities | Villages, coastal, island, and indigenous communities | 55% of planning affects non-urban areas, yet these populations are underrepresented |

## Open Questions

- How can participatory processes be designed to reach non-urban and marginalized communities without imposing disproportionate costs of participation on those communities?
- What role do digital tools play in bridging the participation gap, and do they introduce new forms of exclusion?
- How should the effectiveness of public participation be measured -- by participant satisfaction, decision quality, or long-term trust outcomes?
