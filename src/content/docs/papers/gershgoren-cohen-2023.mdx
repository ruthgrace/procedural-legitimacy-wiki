Gershgoren and Cohen examined factors related to street-level bureaucrats' tendencies to favor the state or citizens, treating Israeli lower-court judges as street-level bureaucrats. Analyzing all 582 lower-court rulings in 425 civil tax disputes, they found that expanded discretionary space, formal certification as state servants, and membership in public organizations were associated with pro-state favoritism in judicial rulings.

The study also identified factors that push in the opposite direction — toward citizen-friendly outcomes. Administrative participation mechanisms such as the right to internally appeal rulings, and the inclusion of lay officials (non-career judges) in mixed decision-making panels, were associated with more citizen-favorable outcomes. This suggests that the direction of street-level bias is not fixed but depends on structural and organizational features of the decision-making environment.

For procedural legitimacy, this research suggests that granting more discretion without changing the organizational context in which it is exercised can make outcomes less fair rather than more fair. The legitimacy implications of discretion depend not just on how much discretion exists but on whose interests it tends to serve — and structural reforms like appealability and mixed panels can counteract pro-state bias.

## Background

The study analyzed all 582 lower-court rulings (in 425 civil tax cases) handed down by dual and singly presiding judges in Israel, with a focused database of 545 conclusive rulings in 399 cases. By treating lower-court judges as street-level bureaucrats — agents who exercise substantial discretion in applying policy to individual cases — Gershgoren and Cohen connected the judicial decision-making literature to the street-level bureaucracy framework. The use of real-world ruling data rather than surveys or experiments reduces common source bias.

## Key Arguments

| Finding | Significance |
|---|---|
| Expanded discretion associated with pro-state bias | Judges with more discretionary space favored the state in tax disputes |
| Formal state certification reinforces state favoritism | Being certified as state servants oriented judges toward state interests |
| Appealability promotes citizen-friendly outcomes | The right to appeal rulings internally counteracted pro-state tendencies |
| Mixed panels with lay officials reduce state bias | Including non-career judges in decision-making panels produced more citizen-favorable rulings |
| Judges as street-level bureaucrats | Lower-court judges exhibit the same discretionary dynamics as other SLBs |

## Open Questions

- Under what organizational conditions does expanded discretion benefit citizens rather than the state?
- Can oversight mechanisms counteract pro-state bias without eliminating beneficial discretion?
- How do different bureaucratic cultures (citizen-oriented vs. state-oriented) shape the direction of discretionary bias?
