Gershgoren and Cohen examined what happens when bureaucrats receive expanded discretion. Studying Israeli bureaucrats, they found that increased discretionary authority led to pro-state favoritism — bureaucrats used their expanded latitude to prioritize government interests over citizen rights. Rather than using discretion to better serve citizens or tailor policy to individual circumstances, bureaucrats with more discretion tilted their decisions in favor of the state.

This finding challenges two common assumptions. First, it challenges the view that more discretion necessarily benefits citizens by allowing individualized, flexible treatment. Second, it challenges the managerial assumption that constraining discretion primarily serves organizational interests. Gershgoren and Cohen show that the direction of discretionary bias depends on organizational culture and incentive structures — and that when bureaucrats identify with the state rather than with citizens, expanded discretion amplifies pro-state outcomes.

For procedural legitimacy, this research suggests that granting more discretion without changing the organizational context in which it is exercised can make outcomes less fair rather than more fair. The legitimacy implications of discretion depend not just on how much discretion exists but on whose interests it tends to serve.

## Background

The study examined Israeli public servants across multiple agencies, using survey and behavioral data to measure how changes in discretionary authority affected decision-making patterns. Israel's bureaucratic system provided a useful context because of recent reforms that expanded discretionary authority in some domains.

## Key Arguments

| Finding | Significance |
|---|---|
| Expanded discretion leads to pro-state bias | More discretion did not benefit citizens |
| Organizational culture shapes discretion direction | Bureaucrats oriented toward state interests used discretion accordingly |
| Challenges pro-discretion assumptions | More flexibility does not automatically mean fairer outcomes |
| Incentive structures matter | The direction of bias depends on who bureaucrats identify with |
| Context-dependent effects | Discretion's impact varies based on organizational culture |

## Open Questions

- Under what organizational conditions does expanded discretion benefit citizens rather than the state?
- Can oversight mechanisms counteract pro-state bias without eliminating beneficial discretion?
- How do different bureaucratic cultures (citizen-oriented vs. state-oriented) shape the direction of discretionary bias?
