**Domain:** Practical management of justice across HR activities (hiring, performance appraisal, rewards, conflict, downsizing)

Most organizational justice research tells us that fairness matters — but how do managers actually *create* it? Cropanzano, Bowen, and Gilliland bridge the gap between theory and practice by showing how organizational justice can be actively managed across five core HR activities: hiring, performance appraisals, reward systems, conflict management, and downsizing. For each activity, they identify specific procedural and interpersonal justice principles that managers can implement to build trust, commitment, and cooperation.

The paper argues that justice is not a fixed organizational trait but a manageable resource. A hiring process can be made fairer by using structured interviews, providing timely feedback, and explaining selection criteria. Performance appraisals can be made fairer by giving employees voice, using consistent standards, and offering clear explanations. Downsizing can be made fairer — or at least less destructive — by providing advance notice, clear rationale, and respectful treatment. In each case, the payoff is measurable: greater trust, improved job performance, more helpful citizenship behaviors, improved customer satisfaction, and reduced conflict.

For HR professionals and managers, this is one of the most actionable papers in the organizational justice literature.

## Background

The paper is written for a practitioner audience (Academy of Management Perspectives targets both academics and managers) and synthesizes findings from across the organizational justice literature into concrete recommendations. It draws heavily on Colquitt's (2001) four-factor framework.

## Key Arguments

| HR Activity | Key Procedural Justice Principles | Expected Outcomes |
|---|---|---|
| Hiring | Structured interviews, job-relevant tests, timely communication | Applicant perceptions of fairness, employer brand |
| Performance appraisal | Employee voice, consistent standards, written explanations | Acceptance of feedback, development motivation |
| Reward systems | Transparent criteria, consistent application, appeals process | Pay satisfaction, organizational commitment |
| Conflict management | Neutral third parties, opportunity to be heard, respectful process | Resolution acceptance, relationship preservation |
| Downsizing | Advance notice, clear rationale, dignified treatment | Survivor trust and commitment, reduced litigation |

## Open Questions

- How do these recommendations translate to remote and hybrid work environments?
- Can algorithmic HR tools (automated screening, AI performance reviews) be designed to satisfy procedural justice criteria?
- Do employees weigh procedural and interpersonal justice differently across these five HR activities?
