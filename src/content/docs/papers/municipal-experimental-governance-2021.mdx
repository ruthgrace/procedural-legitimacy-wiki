Cities around the world are embracing "experimental governance" — using urban living labs, testbeds, and pilot projects to trial innovative approaches to sustainability, mobility, and public services. But when municipalities experiment, do they maintain democratic legitimacy? Eneqvist, Karvonen, Algehed, and Jensen investigate this question through a four-year multi-case study of experimental governance practices in Stockholm and Gothenburg. They find a troubling pattern: municipal experiments tend to prioritize output legitimacy (demonstrating results and problem-solving capacity) while neglecting input legitimacy (democratic authorization and citizen participation) and throughput legitimacy (the transparency and inclusiveness of the policymaking process itself).

This matters because urban experiments often operate through informal, partnership-based arrangements — triple helix collaborations among government, industry, and academia — that bypass the formal democratic processes through which municipal decisions are ordinarily made. Public hearings, council votes, and transparent procurement processes may be sidestepped in favor of agile, flexible arrangements that privilege speed and innovation. The authors argue that this creates a legitimacy deficit: even when experiments produce useful outcomes, they may undermine the municipality's duty to protect the public good if citizens have no meaningful role in shaping, overseeing, or contesting the experimental process. The study calls for municipalities to develop explicit strategies for integrating democratic legitimacy into experimental governance, rather than treating innovation and accountability as competing imperatives.

## Background

The study draws on Scharpf's (1999) distinction between input legitimacy (the democratic quality of the process leading to a decision) and output legitimacy (the effectiveness of the decision's results), supplemented by the concept of throughput legitimacy (Schmidt, 2013), which focuses on the quality and inclusiveness of governance processes themselves. The authors conducted longitudinal case studies over four years, observing municipal innovation projects, interviewing stakeholders, and analyzing planning documents in both cities. The Swedish context is particularly revealing because Swedish municipalities have strong traditions of both democratic governance and innovation, making the tension between the two especially visible.

## Key Arguments

| Legitimacy Type | Definition | Status in Municipal Experiments |
|---|---|---|
| Input legitimacy | Democratic authorization: citizen participation, electoral accountability, formal procedures | Neglected: experiments often bypass formal democratic channels |
| Throughput legitimacy | Process quality: transparency, inclusiveness, deliberation during governance | Underdeveloped: informal partnerships reduce transparency and public oversight |
| Output legitimacy | Results: effective problem-solving, measurable outcomes | Prioritized: experiments are evaluated primarily by what they deliver |
| Public good protection | Municipality's responsibility to serve all residents equitably | At risk: experiments may serve partner interests over public interests |
| Triple helix partnerships | Government-industry-academia collaborations | Enable innovation but can marginalize citizen voice |

## Open Questions

- How can municipalities design experimental governance processes that are both innovative and democratically legitimate — is there a way to embed participatory mechanisms without sacrificing the flexibility that makes experimentation valuable?
- Do citizens actually care about input and throughput legitimacy in experimental governance, or are they satisfied if experiments produce good outcomes (pure output legitimacy)?
- How do the legitimacy dynamics of municipal experiments differ across institutional contexts — for example, between the strong municipal traditions of Scandinavia and the more fragmented local governance structures of the United States or United Kingdom?
