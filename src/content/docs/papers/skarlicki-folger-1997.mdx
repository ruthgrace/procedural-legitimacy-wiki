When employees feel treated unfairly, some comply grudgingly — and some retaliate. Skarlicki and Folger studied 240 manufacturing employees to understand when perceived injustice leads to retaliatory behavior: sabotage, theft, deliberate slowdowns, spreading rumors, or other acts directed against the organization. Their key finding is that the three dimensions of justice interact in a specific pattern. Distributive injustice (unfair outcomes) only predicts retaliation when *both* procedural and interactional justice are also low. When either the process is fair or supervisors treat employees with respect, the link between unfair outcomes and retaliation is broken.

This three-way interaction has powerful practical implications. It means that interpersonal justice — simply treating people with dignity and respect — can serve as a buffer against destructive behavior even when outcomes are unfavorable and processes are imperfect. A supervisor who cannot change an employee's pay or promotion outcome can still reduce the risk of retaliation by communicating respectfully, explaining decisions, and showing consideration. Conversely, the combination of unfair pay, opaque processes, and disrespectful treatment creates a combustible mix.

For organizations, the message is that justice dimensions work as a system. Failure on one dimension can be compensated by the others, but failure across all three invites the worst outcomes.

## Background

The study operationalizes retaliation through Skarlicki and Folger's organizational retaliatory behavior (ORB) scale, which measures behaviors ranging from mild (badmouthing the organization) to severe (theft, sabotage). The manufacturing setting provided a context where such behaviors are observable and consequential.

## Key Arguments

| Justice Configuration | Predicted Retaliation Level |
|---|---|
| Low distributive + low procedural + low interactional | Highest retaliation |
| Low distributive + low procedural + high interactional | Moderate (respect buffers) |
| Low distributive + high procedural + low interactional | Moderate (fair process buffers) |
| High distributive (any procedural/interactional) | Low retaliation |

## Open Questions

- Does this three-way interaction hold in service and knowledge-work settings where retaliation takes different forms (quiet quitting, information withholding)?
- How do social media and anonymous review platforms change the retaliation calculus?
- Can training supervisors in interactional justice reduce organizational retaliation behavior at scale?
