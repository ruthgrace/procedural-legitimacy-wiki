**Domain:** Regulatory agency enforcement and sanctioning decisions

Transparency is often held up as a cure-all for government distrust. But does it actually work? Grimmelikhuijsen, Buijze, and de Poorter test whether making a regulatory agency's decision-making process transparent increases citizen trust. Through a representative survey experiment, participants were presented with a regulatory agency's decision to sanction a noncompliant entity. Even when the scenario revealed that the agency was correcting an earlier mistake, overall trust in the agency *increased* when the decision-making process was transparent. Transparency worked through three mechanisms: perceived competence, perceived benevolence, and perceived integrity.

The finding that transparency builds trust even when it reveals mistakes is particularly relevant for local government. Building departments that publish inspection results, zoning boards that explain denial rationales, and code enforcement offices that make their decision criteria public may all benefit — even when some of those decisions are embarrassing or controversial. The study suggests that citizens give government credit for being open, even about imperfect processes.

For local governments debating how much to share about their decision-making, this paper provides experimental evidence that more transparency is almost always better for trust.

## Background

The study uses a representative survey experiment in the Netherlands, presenting participants with vignettes about a regulatory agency's sanctioning decisions that varied in the level of transparency about the decision-making process.

## Key Arguments

| Transparency Level | Effect on Citizen Trust | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| High (process and reasoning visible) | Significant increase in trust | Perceived competence, benevolence, integrity |
| Low (decision announced without explanation) | Lower trust | Citizens infer opacity means something to hide |
| Transparency revealing a mistake | Still increases trust vs. opacity | Honesty about errors signals integrity |

## Open Questions

- Is there a limit to the trust benefits of transparency — can too much information overwhelm or confuse citizens?
- How does transparency interact with other procedural fairness elements (voice, respect)?
- Do local governments face political risks from transparency that national agencies do not?
