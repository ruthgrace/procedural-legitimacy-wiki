This edited volume provides a comprehensive contemporary reference on street-level bureaucracy, synthesizing decades of research since Lipsky's foundational 1980 work. The collection examines how frontline discretion operates across different national contexts and policy domains — from welfare and education to immigration and healthcare — and assesses how well Lipsky's original framework holds up in the era of managerialism, digitalization, and outsourcing.

The volume's contributions show that while the specific forms of street-level discretion have evolved, the fundamental dynamics Lipsky identified remain powerful. Frontline workers continue to exercise substantial discretion, coping mechanisms persist, and the gap between policy design and policy delivery remains a defining feature of public administration. The book also extends the framework to new contexts, examining how discretion operates in multi-level governance systems, in outsourced service delivery, and across different welfare state regimes.

For procedural legitimacy, this volume is valuable as a reference work that documents the universality of discretionary challenges across governance systems. It demonstrates that the procedural legitimacy problems created by discretion are not unique to any one country or policy domain but are inherent in the structure of public administration itself.

## Background

The volume brings together leading scholars of street-level bureaucracy from across Europe and North America, reflecting the internationalization of research that was originally centered on the American context. It was published 35 years after Lipsky's original work and serves both as an assessment of how the field has developed and as an agenda for future research.

## Key Arguments

| Theme | Finding |
|---|---|
| Discretion persists | Despite managerial reforms, frontline workers retain substantial discretion |
| Cross-national validity | Lipsky's framework applies across different governance traditions |
| New forms of discretion | Outsourcing, digitalization, and multi-level governance create new discretionary dynamics |
| Accountability gaps | Existing oversight mechanisms often fail to reach where discretion is actually exercised |

## Open Questions

- How does the structure of welfare states (liberal, conservative, social-democratic) shape the nature of street-level discretion?
- What new forms of discretion are created by algorithmic and automated decision-making systems?
- Can comparative research identify institutional designs that consistently produce better discretionary outcomes?
