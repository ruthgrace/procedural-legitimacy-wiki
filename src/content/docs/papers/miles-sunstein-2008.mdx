Miles and Sunstein examined how courts actually apply "arbitrary and capricious" review to agency decisions, and their empirical findings revealed a troubling pattern: judicial review itself is politicized. Judges appointed by Republican presidents are significantly more likely to strike down liberal agency actions as arbitrary, while judges appointed by Democratic presidents are more likely to strike down conservative agency actions. The "neutral" check on bureaucratic discretion turns out to be substantially influenced by judicial ideology.

This finding complicates the assumption that judicial review provides an effective, neutral constraint on arbitrary bureaucratic action. If the reviewers themselves bring systematic biases, then judicial review may not reduce arbitrariness so much as add another layer of ideologically influenced discretion. The quality of legal constraint on bureaucratic discretion depends on who is doing the constraining — a finding that parallels the street-level bureaucracy literature's insight that discretion cannot be eliminated, only relocated.

For procedural legitimacy, Miles and Sunstein's work suggests that legal safeguards against arbitrary discretion are weaker than they appear. If judicial review is systematically biased, then citizens cannot rely on courts to ensure that bureaucratic decisions are reasoned and consistent. This underscores the need for structural reforms — clear standards, required findings, transparent processes — that reduce the need for judicial intervention in the first place.

## Background

Miles and Sunstein analyzed a dataset of federal court of appeals decisions reviewing agency actions under the "arbitrary and capricious" standard of the Administrative Procedure Act. They coded decisions by the political party of the appointing president and by the ideological direction of the agency action being reviewed.

## Key Arguments

| Finding | Significance |
|---|---|
| Judicial review is politicized | Judges' ideological orientation predicts review outcomes |
| Republican-appointed judges | More likely to strike down liberal agency actions |
| Democratic-appointed judges | More likely to strike down conservative agency actions |
| Panel effects | Ideological composition of the three-judge panel matters |
| "Neutral" review is not neutral | The check on agency discretion is itself subject to bias |

## Open Questions

- Can institutional reforms (random panel assignment, en banc review) reduce politicization of arbitrariness review?
- Does politicized judicial review still improve agency decision-making by creating uncertainty?
- Would clearer statutory standards reduce the space for ideological influence in judicial review?
