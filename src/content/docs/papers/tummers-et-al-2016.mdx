Everyone has a red tape horror story — endless forms, unexplained requirements, contradictory instructions from different offices. But does red tape actually affect how citizens view their government? Tummers et al. test this experimentally with 179 participants and find that red tape has a strong negative effect on citizen satisfaction with government. The study is one of the first to examine red tape from the *citizen's* perspective rather than the bureaucrat's, shifting the frame from organizational efficiency to citizen experience.

The connection to procedural legitimacy is direct: red tape is experienced as procedural unfairness. Burdensome, opaque, and seemingly pointless administrative requirements violate the core procedural justice principles of transparency, respect for people's time, and adequate explanation. When a resident needs three separate permits from three different offices to build a fence, each with its own forms and timelines and no explanation of why, the experience communicates that the government does not value their time or consider their perspective.

One interesting moderating finding: citizens with high knowledge of political processes are somewhat buffered from the negative effect of red tape. They may understand *why* bureaucratic requirements exist and be less frustrated by them. This suggests that transparency and explanation — telling people why a process is structured the way it is — could mitigate some of red tape's legitimacy costs.

## Background

The study uses an experimental design where participants read vignettes about government interactions that varied in the amount of red tape (burdensome procedures, excessive paperwork, unclear requirements) and then rated their satisfaction with government.

## Key Arguments

| Condition | Citizen Satisfaction |
|---|---|
| Low red tape | Higher satisfaction with government |
| High red tape | Significantly lower satisfaction |
| High red tape + high political knowledge | Moderate satisfaction (knowledge buffers the effect) |
| High red tape + low political knowledge | Lowest satisfaction |

## Open Questions

- Can local governments reduce perceived red tape through better process design without actually reducing regulatory requirements?
- How much of the red tape effect is about the burden itself vs. the lack of explanation for why it's necessary?
- Do digital government services (online portals, automated processes) reduce or merely relocate the red tape problem?
