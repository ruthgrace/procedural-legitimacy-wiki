**Published:** 2024, Routledge

**Domain:** Public administration ethics, street-level bureaucracy, policy implementation

Koven extends Adams and Balfour's framework of "administrative evil" by connecting it directly to street-level discretion. Through case studies ranging from welfare administration to immigration enforcement, Koven shows how the conditions of frontline work — heavy caseloads, ambiguous rules, organizational pressure, and emotional distance from policy consequences — create environments where harmful discretion becomes normalized. The book argues that administrative evil is not confined to extreme historical episodes but is an ongoing risk embedded in the routine operations of government.

Koven's contribution is to bridge the gap between the philosophical concept of administrative evil and the empirical reality of street-level bureaucracy. Where Adams and Balfour focused on large-scale moral failures, Koven documents how smaller-scale harms accumulate through everyday discretionary decisions. A caseworker who routinely denies benefits to "undeserving" applicants, an inspector who selectively enforces rules against certain communities, or an immigration officer who exercises maximum severity — each represents administrative evil operating at the street level.

For procedural legitimacy, the book underscores that fair procedures are not enough if the people implementing them bring organizational pressures and moral judgments that systematically produce unjust outcomes. The procedural legitimacy of government depends on the conditions under which frontline workers exercise their authority.

## Background

Koven builds on the administrative evil literature established by Adams and Balfour, combining it with Lipsky's street-level bureaucracy framework and contemporary case studies. The book addresses a gap in the literature by examining how the abstract concept of administrative evil manifests in the daily decisions of frontline government workers.

## Key Arguments

| Theme | Finding |
|---|---|
| Street-level administrative evil | Harmful discretion is normalized through routine frontline work |
| Organizational conditions | Heavy caseloads, ambiguity, and pressure create environments for harmful discretion |
| Emotional distance | Bureaucratic processing creates psychological distance from human consequences |
| Case studies | Welfare, immigration, and policing show harmful discretion in everyday operations |
| Systemic risk | Administrative evil is an ongoing structural risk, not just a historical anomaly |

## Open Questions

- What organizational interventions can reduce the normalization of harmful discretion without eliminating necessary flexibility?
- How do frontline workers themselves understand the ethical dimensions of their discretionary decisions?
- Can training programs or reflective practices help street-level bureaucrats recognize when routine discretion becomes harmful?
