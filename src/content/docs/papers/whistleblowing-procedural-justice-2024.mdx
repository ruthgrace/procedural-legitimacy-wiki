Whistleblowing is typically studied as an individual act of courage or dissent, but this paper asks a different question: can whistleblowing claims, when processed through neutral resolution mechanisms, actually reshape procedural justice within public organizations? Drawing on evidence from the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) — the federal agency responsible for investigating whistleblower complaints — the study examines whether the formal resolution of whistleblowing claims produces organizational changes that go beyond addressing the specific complaint. The findings suggest that when whistleblowing claims are handled through structured, neutral processes, they can serve as a catalyst for broader procedural improvements within the targeted organization.

The study connects the discovery of procedural violations (through whistleblowing) to organizational reform, showing that the mechanism of investigation matters. When claims are processed through credible, independent channels that apply neutral procedures, the outcome is more likely to include systemic remedies — changes to processes, policies, and oversight structures — rather than merely individual sanctions. This positions whistleblowing not just as a discovery mechanism for violations but as a potential driver of procedural justice enhancement when supported by appropriate institutional infrastructure.

## Background

The U.S. Office of Special Counsel is an independent federal investigative and prosecutorial agency that, among other functions, receives and investigates whistleblower disclosures from federal employees. The OSC process is notable for its procedural features: claims are investigated through structured processes with defined standards of evidence, and findings are referred to the relevant agency for corrective action. The study examines cases where OSC investigations led to substantiated findings, analyzing the types of organizational changes that resulted. This institutional setting provides a unique window into how formalized whistleblowing resolution can function as a procedural justice mechanism at the organizational level.

## Key Arguments

| Finding | Detail |
|---|---|
| Organizational-level effects | Whistleblowing claims processed through neutral mechanisms can produce systemic organizational changes, not just individual remedies |
| Process matters | The structure of the resolution mechanism (neutral, independent, procedurally rigorous) shapes whether the outcome includes systemic reform |
| Beyond individual complaints | When handled well, whistleblowing serves as a diagnostic tool that reveals broader procedural deficiencies |
| Institutional infrastructure | Effective whistleblowing resolution requires credible, independent channels — the OSC model demonstrates this |
| Procedural justice connection | Neutral resolution processes embody procedural justice principles and can propagate those principles to the investigated organization |

## Open Questions

- Under what conditions do organizations implement systemic reforms in response to whistleblowing findings versus minimal compliance?
- How do employees in the investigated organization perceive the procedural justice of the whistleblowing resolution process itself?
- Can the OSC model be adapted for state and local government contexts, or does it depend on the specific features of the federal system?
