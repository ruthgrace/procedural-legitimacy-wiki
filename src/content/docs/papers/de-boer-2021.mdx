When a building inspector shows up at your door, does their style of enforcement affect whether you comply? de Boer examines the tension street-level bureaucrats face between ensuring citizen obedience through enforcement and risking public backlash. She identifies three enforcement styles: legal (strict rule application), facilitation (helping citizens understand and meet requirements), and accommodation (flexible, negotiated compliance). The key finding challenges common assumptions: in one-shot public encounters where relational distance is high — typical of many local government interactions like inspections and code enforcement — neither a strictly legal nor a facilitation-oriented enforcement style reliably stimulates citizen intentions to obey.

This is a sobering finding for local governments that invest in training inspectors to be either "tough" or "helpful." When a citizen meets an inspector once and has no ongoing relationship, the usual mechanisms of procedural justice (building trust, signaling respect) may not have enough time to take effect. The study suggests that the transactional nature of many local government enforcement encounters — brief, one-time, with a stranger — limits the power of enforcement style to shape compliance.

The practical implication is that local governments may need to think beyond individual encounter style and focus on systemic design: clear rules, accessible information, and reputation-building over time.

## Background

The study draws on Lipsky's street-level bureaucracy framework and uses experimental methods to test how different enforcement styles affect citizen compliance intentions. The "one-shot" framing is representative of many local government interactions (inspections, code enforcement checks) where the citizen and bureaucrat are unlikely to interact again.

## Key Arguments

| Enforcement Style | Description | Effect on Compliance (One-Shot Encounter) |
|---|---|---|
| Legal | Strict rule application, formal process | Weak or no effect on compliance intentions |
| Facilitation | Helping citizens understand requirements | Weak or no effect on compliance intentions |
| Accommodation | Flexible, negotiated compliance | Mixed results |

The finding: **in one-shot encounters, enforcement style matters less than expected.** Systemic design may matter more.

## Open Questions

- Do repeated encounters (ongoing relationships with a regular inspector) restore the power of enforcement style?
- Can local governments build "institutional relationships" that substitute for personal ones (e.g., a trusted building department brand)?
- How does the citizen's prior attitude toward government moderate the effect of enforcement style?
