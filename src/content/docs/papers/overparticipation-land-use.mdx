**Domain:** Land use planning, zoning, and public participation (United States)

More public participation in land use decisions sounds like an unalloyed good -- but what if the people who actually show up are not representative of the broader community, and the process itself systematically amplifies voices that oppose change? Lemar makes a provocative argument: the current structure of public participation in American land use regulation leads to "overparticipation" by a narrow, unrepresentative group of nearby homeowners, while systematically excluding the interests of future residents, renters, people of color, and lower-income households. The result is not more democratic governance but less of it, as participation processes become tools for exclusion, delay, and the preservation of existing privilege.

The article traces how public participation in zoning and land use decisions became entrenched in American law, and how a long history of community control has been used to cement racial segregation, entrench exclusion, and prevent the development of affordable housing. Lemar does not argue against participation itself, but rather contends that the current model is broken. She proposes a redesign that draws lessons from other areas of administrative law -- particularly federal rulemaking -- to create land use processes that balance public input with legal standards, expertise, and accountability. Her reform proposals include setting clear goals and purposes for planning, making more development "as-of-right" to reduce discretionary choke points, requiring reasoned written explanations for denials, and restructuring public hearings to be more inclusive and less dominated by organized opposition groups.

## Background

The article is situated at the intersection of land use law, administrative law, and housing policy. Lemar builds on a growing body of scholarship documenting how local land use regulation contributes to housing unaffordability, racial segregation, and economic inequality. She draws on the administrative law tradition that distinguishes between rulemaking (general policy) and adjudication (individual cases), arguing that land use processes should learn from the procedural innovations in federal rulemaking, such as notice-and-comment procedures that are designed to solicit broad input rather than privileging those who attend a hearing. The article was recognized as one of the top three land use law review articles of the year.

## Key Arguments

| Problem with Current Participation | Effect | Proposed Reform |
|---|---|---|
| Dominated by nearby homeowners | Excludes renters, future residents, people of color | Broaden outreach; use representative input mechanisms |
| Forum for local prejudice | Allows opposition based on bias to influence decisions | Require reasoned explanations tied to legal standards |
| Protects the wrong social capital | Entrenches existing wealth and privilege | Shift more development to as-of-right approvals |
| Redistributes resources in wrong direction | Blocks affordable housing and transit | Set clear planning goals that prioritize equity |
| Treats all decisions as discretionary | Creates veto points for organized opposition | Distinguish between planning (rulemaking) and permits (adjudication) |
| Lacks accountability | Decision-makers face no obligation to explain denials | Require written findings for discretionary decisions |

## Open Questions

- Can as-of-right zoning reforms be adopted at scale without triggering political backlash from homeowners who view participation as a democratic right?
- How should jurisdictions balance the legitimate interests of existing residents with the needs of people who do not yet live in a community?
- What institutional designs best ensure that participation processes attract a broadly representative set of voices, rather than just the loudest ones?
