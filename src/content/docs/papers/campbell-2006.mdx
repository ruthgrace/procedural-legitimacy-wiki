Planning theory since the 1990s has been dominated by a procedural turn — the idea that if planners get the *process* right (inclusive, transparent, deliberative), just outcomes will follow. Campbell pushes back against this assumption. She argues that planning justice requires more than fair procedures: it demands "situated ethical judgment," the ability of planners to engage with substantive questions about what constitutes a good outcome in specific contexts. Planners cannot hide behind process and avoid making value-laden decisions about the built environment and the distribution of public goods.

This is not an argument against procedural fairness — Campbell acknowledges its importance — but rather an argument that procedural fairness alone is insufficient. A zoning board that runs a flawless public hearing process but approves a development that concentrates environmental burdens on a low-income neighborhood has not achieved justice, even if the process was fair. Campbell contends that planners must develop the ethical capacity to grapple with these substantive tensions rather than retreating to purely procedural legitimation.

For local government practitioners, the paper raises uncomfortable questions about the limits of procedural legitimacy. It suggests that city planners, zoning administrators, and planning commissioners have an obligation to think critically about outcomes — not just to follow procedures — and that professional education should prepare them for this role.

## Background

Campbell writes from within the communicative planning tradition (Healey, Forester, Innes) but critiques its tendency to reduce justice to process. She draws on Aristotelian practical wisdom (*phronesis*) and feminist ethics of care to argue for a richer conception of planning judgment.

## Key Arguments

| Position | Proceduralist View | Campbell's Critique |
|---|---|---|
| Source of legitimacy | Fair process legitimates outcomes | Fair process is necessary but not sufficient |
| Role of the planner | Neutral facilitator of democratic deliberation | Ethical agent who must engage with substantive values |
| Justice standard | Was the process inclusive and transparent? | Was the outcome fair, and did the process enable fair outcomes? |
| Professional education | Teach process skills | Teach ethical judgment alongside process skills |

## Open Questions

- If planners are expected to make substantive value judgments, how do they maintain democratic accountability?
- How should local governments balance procedural legitimacy with substantive justice when the two conflict?
- Can planning education effectively teach "situated ethical judgment," or is this a skill that only develops through practice?
