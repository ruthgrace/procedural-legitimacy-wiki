Fischel traced how homeowners became the dominant force in local land use politics and how zoning became the primary tool for exclusionary purposes. His central argument is economic: because a home is most families' largest asset and homeowners cannot diversify against declines in home value, they have powerful incentives to use the political process to restrict development that might reduce property values. Zoning provides the discretionary mechanism through which this protection operates.

The article provides a historical account of how zoning evolved from a public health and safety measure into a tool for protecting property values and excluding unwanted development and populations. Fischel shows that the discretionary nature of zoning decisions — where boards can approve or deny projects based on broad, subjective criteria — gives organized homeowners effective veto power over new development. The result is a systematic pattern of exclusionary zoning that restricts housing supply, inflates prices, and reinforces economic and racial segregation.

For procedural legitimacy, Fischel's analysis reveals how formally democratic processes — public hearings, elected zoning boards, community input — can produce systematically exclusionary outcomes. The discretion embedded in land use processes allows those with the most at stake economically (homeowners) to dominate decisions that affect broader community interests.

## Background

Fischel is an economist who has written extensively on local government and property taxation. This article synthesizes his broader body of work on the "homevoter hypothesis" — the idea that homeowners' economic interests in property values drive local politics, particularly land use regulation.

## Key Arguments

| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| Homevoter hypothesis | Homeowners dominate local politics because their home is their largest undiversified asset |
| Zoning as protection | Zoning evolved from public health tool to property value protection mechanism |
| Discretionary veto power | Broad zoning discretion gives organized homeowners effective veto over development |
| Exclusionary effects | Restricted supply inflates prices and reinforces segregation |
| Economic incentives | Rational self-interest, not just prejudice, drives exclusionary zoning |

## Open Questions

- Can state-level zoning reforms override local exclusionary incentives while preserving meaningful local input?
- Would compensating homeowners for value changes reduce opposition to development?
- How do exclusionary zoning patterns differ between strong home-rule states and states with more centralized land use authority?
