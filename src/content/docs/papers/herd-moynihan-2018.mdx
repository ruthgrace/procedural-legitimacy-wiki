Herd and Moynihan reframed the entire discussion of bureaucratic discretion by arguing that administrative burdens — complex application processes, documentation requirements, waiting periods, confusing rules — are not accidental byproducts of bureaucracy but deliberate policy choices. By making it difficult to access benefits or exercise rights, governments exercise a form of structural discretion that does not depend on individual bureaucrats making biased decisions. The system itself screens out those who lack the resources, knowledge, or persistence to navigate bureaucratic obstacles.

The authors distinguish three types of administrative burden: learning costs (figuring out what programs exist and how to apply), compliance costs (gathering documentation and completing procedures), and psychological costs (the stigma, stress, and frustration of engaging with bureaucracy). Each type operates as a filter that reduces access to public benefits, with the heaviest effects falling on those who are already disadvantaged — the elderly, people with disabilities, those with limited education, and racial minorities.

For procedural legitimacy, this work is devastating: a system that is formally open to all but practically accessible only to those with significant social capital cannot claim procedural fairness. Administrative burden represents a form of structural procedural unfairness that operates through process design rather than individual discretion, making it harder to identify and challenge.

## Background

Herd and Moynihan draw on extensive case studies of American social programs — including Medicaid, voter registration, and Social Security — to document how administrative burdens shape access to government benefits and rights. Their framework builds on earlier work by Moynihan and colleagues on learning, psychological, and compliance costs in citizen-state interactions.

## Key Arguments

| Burden Type | How It Operates | Who Is Most Affected |
|---|---|---|
| Learning costs | Citizens must discover programs exist and understand how to apply | Those with less education, fewer social networks |
| Compliance costs | Documentation, forms, appointments, waiting periods | Those with less time, transportation, documentation |
| Psychological costs | Stigma, stress, frustration, loss of autonomy | Those already facing marginalization and stress |

## Open Questions

- Can digital government reduce administrative burdens, or does it merely shift them to new forms?
- How should policymakers balance the legitimate purposes of administrative requirements (preventing fraud, verifying eligibility) with the costs burdens impose?
- What political dynamics explain why administrative burdens are imposed on some programs (welfare) but not others (mortgage interest deduction)?
