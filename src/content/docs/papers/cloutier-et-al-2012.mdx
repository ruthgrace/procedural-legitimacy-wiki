**Domain:** Union-management collective bargaining

Collective bargaining is a process where fairness perceptions can determine whether workers accept a contract, vote to strike, or cooperate with management during implementation. Despite this, the organizational justice literature has largely focused on individual-level HR decisions (pay, appraisals, layoffs) rather than collective processes. Cloutier, Denis, and Bilodeau address this gap by developing and validating a measure of perceived fairness in collective bargaining. Their analysis reveals eight distinct dimensions, crossing two sources of potential injustice (employer and union) with four types of justice (procedural, distributive, interpersonal, and informational).

The finding that employees evaluate the fairness of *both* the employer and the union independently is important. A worker might perceive the employer as procedurally fair but the union as informationally unfair (or vice versa). This dual-source structure means that both management and union leadership have independent responsibilities for maintaining procedural legitimacy during bargaining. Neither can assume that the other party's unfairness will reflect well on them by contrast.

For labor relations practitioners, the paper provides a validated instrument for diagnosing where fairness perceptions are breaking down during bargaining — and whether the problem lies with management, the union, or both.

## Background

The study draws on Colquitt's (2001) four-factor justice framework and extends it to the collective bargaining context. The validation sample included unionized employees in Canadian organizations.

## Key Arguments

| Source of Justice | Procedural | Distributive | Interpersonal | Informational |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Employer | Was the negotiation process fair? | Is the contract offer fair? | Did management treat bargaining team with respect? | Did management explain its positions adequately? |
| Union | Did the union conduct bargaining fairly? | Did the union achieve fair outcomes? | Did union reps treat members with respect? | Did the union keep members informed? |

Eight distinct dimensions = 2 sources x 4 justice types.

## Open Questions

- How do these eight dimensions predict specific bargaining outcomes (contract ratification, strike votes, grievance rates)?
- Does the dual-source model apply to other collective contexts (shareholder votes, community negotiations)?
- How does social media and real-time information sharing change the informational justice dynamics during bargaining?
