Pendall mapped the systematic relationship between land use regulatory tools and exclusionary outcomes. Using data from a national survey of local planning directors, he showed that certain regulatory mechanisms — large-lot zoning, limits on multifamily housing, caps on building permits, and the absence of inclusionary housing requirements — form a "chain of exclusion" that restricts housing affordability and racial diversity. Each link in the chain individually limits housing options, and together they produce communities that are more expensive and less racially diverse.

The concept of the "chain of exclusion" reveals how discretion operates at a systemic level. No single regulatory tool may appear exclusionary on its face — large-lot zoning can be justified on environmental grounds, building permit caps can be justified by infrastructure capacity — but the cumulative effect of these discretionary choices is a systematic pattern of exclusion. The discretion to choose which regulatory tools to adopt, how stringently to apply them, and where to make exceptions allows local governments to achieve exclusionary outcomes while maintaining the appearance of neutral regulation.

For procedural legitimacy, Pendall's analysis shows that procedural fairness cannot be assessed at the level of individual decisions alone. A zoning board may follow proper procedures in every case and still produce systematically exclusionary outcomes if the regulatory framework within which it operates is designed to exclude.

## Background

Pendall used data from a 1994 national survey of planning directors in 1,510 communities, combined with census data on housing outcomes and demographics. This large-scale quantitative approach allowed him to identify systematic patterns across hundreds of communities.

## Key Arguments

| Regulatory Tool | Exclusionary Effect |
|---|---|
| Large-lot zoning | Increases housing costs, excludes lower-income households |
| Limits on multifamily housing | Reduces rental options, excludes renters |
| Building permit caps | Restricts supply, inflates prices |
| Absence of inclusionary requirements | No countervailing force to promote affordability |
| Cumulative effect ("chain") | Individual tools combine to produce systematic exclusion |

## Open Questions

- Which links in the chain of exclusion are most amenable to reform?
- Can state-level interventions break the chain without undermining all local land use authority?
- How has the chain of exclusion evolved since the 1990s data Pendall analyzed?
