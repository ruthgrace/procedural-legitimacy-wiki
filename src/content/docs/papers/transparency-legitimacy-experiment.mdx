**Domain:** Government transparency, democratic legitimacy, and decision-making processes (Sweden)

Transparency is widely assumed to be good for democratic legitimacy. If citizens can see how decisions are made, the reasoning goes, they are more likely to accept those decisions as legitimate. De Fine Licht and colleagues put this assumption to the test using vignette experiments, and find that the relationship between transparency and legitimacy is far more complicated than the conventional wisdom suggests. The common notion of a straightforward positive correlation, they argue, is naive -- and transparency reforms are rather unpredictable phenomena.

The experiments focused on representative decision-making in schools, where participants were exposed to different combinations of process transparency and postdecisional justification. The core finding is that transparency can generate legitimacy, but the form it takes matters enormously. Full "fishbowl transparency" -- opening the entire decision-making process to public observation -- does not automatically produce higher legitimacy. In fact, decision-makers can improve their legitimacy simply by providing careful justifications after the fact for decisions made behind closed doors. Only when the decision-making process displayed behavior close to a deliberative democratic ideal -- with genuine discussion, consideration of multiple viewpoints, and respectful exchange -- did full process transparency outperform closed-door decisions with postdecisional explanations. This means that transparency can backfire: if the public observes a process that appears rushed, politically motivated, or disrespectful, opening the doors may actually reduce legitimacy rather than enhance it.

## Background

The study is part of a broader research program at the University of Gothenburg examining transparency and democratic governance. The authors draw on democratic theory (which generally champions transparency as essential to accountability) and social psychology (which highlights how people form fairness judgments). Their experimental approach varies both the openness of the decision-making process and the quality of postdecisional justifications. The vignette design allows them to isolate the causal effect of transparency from confounding factors that plague observational studies. The research addresses a gap in the literature where transparency's benefits are often asserted rather than empirically tested.

## Key Arguments

| Condition | Legitimacy Effect | Explanation |
|---|---|---|
| Closed doors + no justification | Lowest legitimacy | Citizens have no information about process or reasoning |
| Closed doors + careful justification | Moderate to high legitimacy | Postdecisional explanation satisfies accountability needs |
| Full transparency + poor deliberation | Low legitimacy | Seeing a flawed process reduces trust |
| Full transparency + deliberative ideal | Highest legitimacy | Observing genuine deliberation validates the decision |
| Transparency as a general policy | Context-dependent | Effects depend on the quality of the process being revealed |

## Open Questions

- If transparency can backfire when processes are of low quality, does this create perverse incentives for governments to keep problematic processes hidden?
- How do these experimental findings translate to real-world settings where citizens receive transparency through media coverage rather than direct observation?
- Do the context-bound effects of transparency differ across policy domains -- for instance, is transparency more consistently beneficial in land use decisions than in school governance?
