Can the act of collecting property taxes — often seen as purely extractive — actually strengthen the relationship between citizens and their local government? Weigel's remarkable field experiment across 356 neighborhoods in a Congolese city found that it can. Property tax collection not only raised compliance (from 0.1% to 11.6%) but also increased political participation by about 5 percentage points. Citizens in taxed neighborhoods were more likely to attend town hall meetings and submit evaluations of government performance. They also updated their perceptions of government legitimacy, perceiving more revenue collection, less corruption, and greater governmental responsibility.

This finding inverts the common assumption that taxation breeds resentment. When citizens are asked to pay property taxes, they interpret the request as a signal that the government is functioning — that it exists, has capacity, and takes its responsibilities seriously. The act of taxation creates a reciprocal relationship: citizens pay and then expect (and demand) something in return, increasing engagement. For local governments, this suggests that even the most basic administrative function — collecting taxes — can build rather than erode legitimacy, provided it is experienced as a genuine governance effort rather than arbitrary extraction.

The Quarterly Journal of Economics publication signals the quality and ambition of this study, which is one of the strongest causal tests of the relationship between local government administrative capacity and citizen legitimacy perceptions.

## Background

The study uses a randomized field experiment in Kananga, a city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where property tax collection had effectively collapsed. The randomization was at the neighborhood level, with tax collectors deployed to treatment neighborhoods. Outcomes were measured through surveys, administrative data, and behavioral measures.

## Key Arguments

| Outcome | Effect of Tax Collection Campaign |
|---|---|
| Tax compliance | Increased from 0.1% to 11.6% |
| Town hall meeting attendance | Increased by ~5 percentage points |
| Submission of government evaluations | Significantly increased |
| Perceived government legitimacy | Positive update (more revenue perceived, less corruption assumed) |
| Demand for government accountability | Increased — citizens expected services in return |

## Open Questions

- Does this participation dividend generalize to contexts where government capacity is already higher and taxation is routine?
- What happens when citizens pay taxes but services don't improve — does the legitimacy effect reverse?
- Can the participation dividend be enhanced through procedurally fair tax collection practices (respectful treatment, clear explanations)?
