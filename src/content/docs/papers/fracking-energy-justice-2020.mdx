**Domain:** Energy siting decisions, local government trust, and public participation (Colorado)

When a local government finds itself caught between state-level energy policy and community opposition to fracking, can the way it manages public meetings rebuild trust? Marlin-Tackie, Polunci, and Smith investigate this question by comparing two Colorado communities that negotiated memorandums of understanding (MOUs) with oil and gas operators. These MOUs gave local governments a measure of control over unconventional oil and gas development that state law did not formally require. The authors find that the community whose local government representatives actively facilitated recognition and procedural justice during public meetings — by listening to residents, acknowledging diverse concerns, and making the process transparent — ended the conflict with stronger expressions of trust in local government. In the other community, where public meetings were less attentive to these justice dimensions, trust did not improve.

The study draws on the energy justice framework, which encompasses three pillars: distributional justice (who bears the burdens and benefits), recognition justice (whose voices and identities are acknowledged), and procedural justice (who gets to participate and how). The authors show that all three dimensions matter for rebuilding trust, but the everyday practices of government representatives — how they run meetings, respond to concerns, and frame the decision-making process — are especially consequential for procedural and recognition justice. Notably, even in the community where local government earned trust, residents' attitudes toward the oil and gas industry and state government remained negative or worsened, suggesting that procedural justice at the local level cannot compensate for perceived injustices at other institutional levels.

## Background

The study is situated in Colorado's contentious fracking landscape, where local governments have limited formal authority over oil and gas development due to state preemption. MOUs emerged as a pragmatic workaround, allowing local governments to negotiate operational conditions with energy companies without directly challenging state authority. The authors draw on energy justice theory (Jenkins et al., 2016; Sovacool & Dworkin, 2015) and procedural justice scholarship to analyze how the process of negotiating these MOUs affected community trust. They conducted ethnographic fieldwork over multiple years, observing public meetings and interviewing stakeholders in both communities.

## Key Arguments

| Justice Dimension | Community A (Active Facilitation) | Community B (Limited Facilitation) |
|---|---|---|
| Procedural justice | Government actively sought input, explained reasoning | Meetings were less inclusive, less transparent |
| Recognition justice | Diverse community concerns acknowledged | Some voices marginalized or dismissed |
| Distributional justice | MOU terms reflected community priorities | MOU terms less responsive to community needs |
| Trust in local government | Increased after MOU process | Did not improve significantly |
| Trust in industry/state | Remained negative or worsened | Remained negative or worsened |

## Open Questions

- Can the energy justice framework be extended to other controversial siting decisions (e.g., solar farms, data centers, waste facilities) where local governments face similar trust deficits?
- How durable is the trust built through procedurally just processes — does it persist beyond the immediate controversy, or does it erode without ongoing engagement?
- What training or institutional support do local government officials need to consistently practice recognition and procedural justice in high-conflict settings?
