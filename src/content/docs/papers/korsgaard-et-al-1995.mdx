**Domain:** Top management teams making strategic organizational decisions

Most procedural justice research studies rank-and-file employees reacting to decisions made by others. Korsgaard, Schweiger, and Sapienza ask a different question: does procedural justice matter among the decision-makers themselves? Studying intact management teams making strategic decisions, they found that when team leaders considered member input and allowed members to influence the decision, team members perceived the process as fairer. These fairness perceptions in turn predicted commitment to the decision, attachment to the team, and trust in the leader.

The finding that procedural justice operates at the executive level — not just among frontline workers — has significant implications for corporate governance and leadership. It suggests that CEOs who make strategic decisions without genuine input from their leadership teams risk undermining the very commitment needed to execute those decisions. The fair process effect is not a phenomenon limited to disempowered employees; it operates at every level of the organizational hierarchy.

Perceived fairness partially mediated the effect of procedures on outcomes, confirming that it is the *perception* of fairness, not just the objective features of the process, that drives attitudes and behavior.

## Background

The study used both videotaped observations of actual team decision-making processes and subsequent surveys of team members. The strategic decisions involved real organizational choices with meaningful consequences, adding ecological validity.

## Key Arguments

| Procedural Element | Effect on Team Members |
|---|---|
| Consideration of input | Increases perceived fairness |
| Influence on decision | Increases perceived fairness |
| Perceived fairness | Predicts commitment to the decision |
| Perceived fairness | Predicts attachment to the team |
| Perceived fairness | Predicts trust in the leader |

## Open Questions

- How does virtual decision-making (Zoom meetings, asynchronous communication) affect procedural fairness perceptions in leadership teams?
- Does the need for speed in strategic decisions trade off against procedural fairness?
- How do power dynamics and status differences within teams moderate these effects?
