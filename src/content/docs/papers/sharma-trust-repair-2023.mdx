Trust is easy to break and hard to fix. Sharma, Schoorman, and Ballinger provide a comprehensive review of the trust repair literature, synthesizing decades of research across organizational behavior, management, political science, and interpersonal relations. Their central finding is a deep asymmetry: trust destruction is fast, often triggered by a single salient violation, while trust repair is slow, requiring sustained, credible, and often costly efforts over extended periods. This asymmetry has profound implications for any institution -- corporate or governmental -- that has violated the procedural expectations of its stakeholders.

The review identifies several key patterns in what makes trust repair succeed or fail. Apologies and verbal commitments, while sometimes necessary, are rarely sufficient on their own. Effective trust repair requires substantive demonstrations of changed behavior: structural reforms that prevent recurrence, accountability for those responsible for the violation, and genuine power-sharing or restitution that signals credible commitment. The authors find that the type of violation matters: competence-based violations (the authority made an honest mistake) are generally easier to repair than integrity-based violations (the authority deliberately deceived or manipulated). Procedural violations -- rigging a process, excluding affected parties, ignoring established rules -- tend to fall into the integrity category, making them particularly damaging and difficult to repair. For organizations and governments that have lost trust through procedural failures, the review's message is sobering: repair is possible, but it demands far more than promises.

## Background

The review synthesizes research from multiple disciplines, including organizational trust theory (Mayer, Davis, & Schoorman, 1995), political trust research, and experimental studies of trust games. The authors organize the literature around a framework that distinguishes trust violations by type (competence vs. integrity), repair strategies by modality (verbal vs. behavioral), and outcomes by time horizon (immediate vs. sustained). They note that much of the existing research uses laboratory experiments with short time horizons, leaving questions about long-term trust repair in naturalistic settings relatively underexplored.

## Key Arguments

| Trust Repair Dimension | Finding |
|---|---|
| Speed asymmetry | Trust destruction is rapid (single event); trust repair is slow (sustained effort) |
| Verbal repair (apologies, explanations) | Necessary but insufficient; often perceived as cheap talk without behavioral change |
| Behavioral repair (structural reform, accountability) | More effective, especially for integrity violations; signals credible commitment |
| Competence vs. integrity violations | Competence failures easier to repair; integrity failures (including procedural violations) much harder |
| Cost of repair signals | Repair efforts perceived as costly to the violator are more credible and effective |
| Unilateral vs. bilateral repair | Repair is more effective when it involves the damaged party in designing the remedy |

## Open Questions

- How does trust repair work at scale -- can institutions with millions of stakeholders (tax agencies, police departments) effectively repair trust, or is interpersonal trust repair fundamentally different?
- What role does public accountability (transparency about what went wrong and why) play compared to private remediation?
- How do repeated trust violations affect the feasibility of repair -- is there a point of no return?
