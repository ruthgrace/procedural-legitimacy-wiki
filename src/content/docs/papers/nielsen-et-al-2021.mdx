**Domain:** General bureaucratic encounters with public authorities (welfare, permits, regulations)

When citizens have a negative experience with a government office — a denied permit, a confusing welfare process, an unresponsive bureaucrat — they don't all respond the same way. Nielsen, Nielsen, and Bisgaard identify five distinct coping strategies: "Resisters" (who fight the decision), "Activists" (who mobilize politically), "Accommodators" (who adjust their behavior to comply), "Flighters" (who disengage entirely), and "Cooperators" (who work constructively with the system). The study examines what determines which strategy citizens adopt, and finds that prior experiences with procedural unfairness are a significant predictor.

This typology has important implications for local government. A citizen who experiences procedural unfairness at the building permit office doesn't just become "dissatisfied" in some abstract sense — they adopt a specific behavioral response that has concrete consequences. Resisters generate appeals and complaints that consume staff time. Flighters disengage from civic life entirely, weakening democratic participation. Activists organize opposition that can become politically costly. Only Accommodators and Cooperators produce outcomes that local government would prefer — and these responses are more likely when people perceive the process as fair.

The study suggests that procedural fairness at the front counter has downstream effects on citizen behavior that extend well beyond the immediate interaction.

## Background

The study uses survey data and cluster analysis to identify the five coping types empirically. It draws on Lipsky's street-level bureaucracy framework and the broader literature on citizen-state interactions.

## Key Arguments

| Coping Type | Behavioral Response | Linked to Procedural Fairness? |
|---|---|---|
| Resisters | Fight the decision, appeal, complain | More likely after perceived unfairness |
| Activists | Mobilize politically, organize opposition | More likely after perceived unfairness |
| Accommodators | Adjust behavior, comply with requirements | More likely after perceived fairness |
| Flighters | Disengage from government entirely | More likely after repeated unfairness |
| Cooperators | Work constructively within the system | Most likely after perceived fairness |

## Open Questions

- Can local governments shift citizens from Resister/Flighter to Accommodator/Cooperator through improved procedural design?
- How do repeated encounters compound — does a series of fair interactions build resilience against occasional unfair ones?
- Do different demographic groups tend toward different coping strategies after unfair treatment?
