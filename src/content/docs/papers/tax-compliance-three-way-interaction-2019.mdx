**Domain:** Tax compliance, authority–citizen relations, and justice perceptions (Ethiopia and United States)

What makes citizens *want* to pay their taxes, rather than merely complying out of fear of punishment? Van Dijke, Gobena, and Verboon argue that the answer lies in a three-way interaction between procedural justice, distributive justice, and the perceived power of the tax authority. Across two studies — one with Ethiopian working professionals and another with American taxpayers — they find that when a tax authority is perceived as powerful, either procedural or distributive justice alone can motivate voluntary compliance. Fair treatment by the authority or a sense that tax burdens are distributed equitably can each independently drive willingness to pay. But when authority power is perceived as low, neither form of justice has a significant effect on voluntary compliance.

This finding matters because it integrates two traditionally separate streams of research: the social-psychological literature on justice (which emphasizes fair treatment and equitable outcomes) and the deterrence literature on compliance (which emphasizes enforcement power). The authors show that these forces do not operate independently. Power sets the stage on which justice perceptions play out. A tax authority that is seen as capable of enforcement creates a context in which fair procedures and fair outcomes can build genuine voluntary compliance — not just grudging obedience. The practical implication is that governments cannot rely on enforcement power alone, nor on fairness alone; the combination is what generates the internalized motivation to comply.

## Background

The study draws on the substitutability model of justice, which holds that procedural and distributive justice can compensate for each other: when one is high, the other matters less. The authors extend this model by adding authority power as a boundary condition, building on the "slippery slope" framework of tax compliance (Kirchler, Hoelzl, & Wahl, 2008), which distinguishes between enforced compliance (driven by detection and punishment) and voluntary compliance (driven by trust and perceived legitimacy). They hypothesize that the substitutability of justice forms is contingent on authority power.

## Key Arguments

| Condition | Procedural Justice | Distributive Justice | Effect on Voluntary Compliance |
|---|---|---|---|
| High authority power | High | Low | Voluntary compliance sustained |
| High authority power | Low | High | Voluntary compliance sustained |
| High authority power | High | High | Highest voluntary compliance |
| Low authority power | High | Low | No significant effect |
| Low authority power | Low | High | No significant effect |
| Any power level | Low | Low | Lowest voluntary compliance |

The critical finding is that justice perceptions only translate into voluntary compliance when the tax authority is perceived as powerful. The three-way interaction was significant in both the Ethiopian sample (N = 273) and the U.S. sample (N = 248), and it predicted voluntary — but not enforced — compliance, supporting discriminant validity.

## Open Questions

- Does the three-way interaction hold in regulatory domains beyond taxation, such as environmental compliance, public health mandates, or licensing?
- How do these dynamics play out in contexts where government legitimacy is contested or where tax systems are perceived as fundamentally corrupt?
- What specific signals of authority power matter most — enforcement capacity, perceived competence, or something else?
