**Domain:** Administrative law, agency inaction, judicial review

Bressman extended her analysis of arbitrariness to argue that agencies can abuse discretion not only through affirmative action but through strategic inaction — declining to enforce rules, delaying implementation, or ignoring statutory mandates. An agency that refuses to act on a clear statutory mandate is exercising discretion just as much as one that acts arbitrarily, but this form of abuse is particularly difficult to challenge because courts have traditionally been reluctant to review agency decisions *not* to act.

Bressman argues that judicial review of inaction is necessary to prevent agencies from effectively repealing statutes through non-enforcement. When an agency is given authority and responsibility to regulate, and instead simply declines to do so, it exercises a form of discretionary power that undermines the legislative process. The result is that policy is made not through deliberation and legislation but through bureaucratic inaction — a process that is invisible, unaccountable, and immune from challenge.

For procedural legitimacy, the inaction problem reveals a hidden dimension of discretion. Much attention focuses on how bureaucrats exercise power when they act, but the power not to act — not to enforce, not to implement, not to respond — can be equally consequential. When a building department refuses to enforce codes, when a civil rights agency declines to investigate complaints, when a zoning enforcement office ignores violations, the resulting inaction shapes outcomes as powerfully as any affirmative decision.

## Background

This article builds on Bressman's 2003 article on arbitrariness and legitimacy, extending the framework to address a gap in administrative law: the relative lack of judicial scrutiny of agency inaction. The Supreme Court's decision in *Heckler v. Chaney* (1985) established a strong presumption against judicial review of agency non-enforcement decisions, and Bressman argues this presumption is too broad.

## Key Arguments

| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| Abuse through inaction | Agencies can undermine statutes by declining to enforce them |
| Strategic non-enforcement | Inaction can effectively repeal legislation without legislative process |
| Judicial review gap | Courts rarely review decisions not to act, creating an accountability vacuum |
| Invisible discretion | Inaction is harder to detect and challenge than affirmative action |
| Arbitrariness framework | Inaction should be reviewed under the same arbitrariness standard as action |

## Open Questions

- How can courts distinguish between legitimate prioritization of enforcement resources and strategic non-enforcement?
- Does the rise of agency non-enforcement as a political tool make judicial review of inaction more urgent?
- How should resource constraints factor into arbitrariness review of agency inaction?
