**Authors:** Guy B. Adams and Danny L. Balfour

**Published:** 2015, Routledge (4th edition; first published 1998)

**Domain:** Public administration ethics, organizational behavior, bureaucratic accountability

Adams and Balfour introduced the concept of "administrative evil" — the capacity of ordinary people working within bureaucratic systems to contribute to harmful, even catastrophic, outcomes without recognizing the moral implications of their actions. The technical-rational culture of modern organizations masks the ethical dimensions of administrative action, allowing bureaucrats to participate in harmful policies by reframing moral questions as technical ones. When following procedures, meeting targets, and processing cases become the primary orientation, the human consequences of bureaucratic action can become invisible.

While the book's most dramatic examples involve historical atrocities, the framework applies broadly to everyday bureaucratic settings. The same organizational dynamics — specialization, hierarchy, procedural focus, diffusion of responsibility — that enabled large-scale administrative evil operate in attenuated form wherever discretion produces unjust outcomes. A welfare caseworker who denies benefits based on a narrow interpretation of rules, or a zoning official who uses process to block affordable housing, may be participating in "administrative evil" without recognizing it as such.

For procedural legitimacy, Adams and Balfour's work raises a disturbing possibility: procedurally "correct" action can produce deeply unjust outcomes when the procedures themselves are designed to serve organizational interests rather than citizen welfare. Procedural legitimacy requires not just following rules but ensuring that the rules and their application serve justice.

## Background

The book was first published in 1998 and has been updated through multiple editions. Adams and Balfour draw on the work of Hannah Arendt on the "banality of evil" and Zygmunt Bauman on modernity and the Holocaust, applying these insights to the study of public administration. The fourth edition (2015) incorporates new case studies and addresses contemporary developments.

## Key Arguments

| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| Administrative evil | Ordinary bureaucrats contributing to harmful outcomes through routine work |
| Technical rationality as mask | Reframing moral questions as technical problems hides ethical dimensions |
| Diffusion of responsibility | Bureaucratic specialization means no one person is responsible for harmful outcomes |
| Moral inversion | Harmful actions reframed as necessary or even virtuous through organizational culture |
| Ongoing risk | Administrative evil is not confined to historical extremes but present in routine operations |

## Open Questions

- How can organizations create ethical awareness without paralyzing routine operations?
- What institutional safeguards best prevent the moral inversion that Adams and Balfour describe?
- How do street-level bureaucrats recognize when their routine discretion is producing harmful outcomes?
