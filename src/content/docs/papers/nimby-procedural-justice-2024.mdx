**Domain:** NIMBY infrastructure siting, procedural justice, and social acceptance (China)

Waste incinerators, chemical plants, transmission lines, and other locally unwanted facilities present a governance dilemma: they serve broad public needs but impose concentrated costs on nearby communities, triggering "Not In My Backyard" (NIMBY) opposition. Feng, Liu, and Ge investigate how the four components of procedural justice can help these facilities earn a "social license to operate" (SLO) -- the informal community acceptance that goes beyond formal regulatory approval. Using structural equation modeling (SEM) on survey data, they find that all four components of procedural justice significantly improve community trust and acceptance, but some matter more than others.

The study maps Colquitt's four-component model of procedural justice -- voice (the opportunity to be heard), neutrality (unbiased decision-making), respect (dignified treatment), and trustworthiness (confidence in the decision-maker's intentions) -- onto the specific context of NIMBY infrastructure siting. The most striking finding is that the construction enterprise's informal treatment of the public -- how company representatives actually behave toward and communicate with affected residents -- has the largest influence on social acceptance. By contrast, the government's formal procedural treatment (official regulations and administrative processes) has the least influence. This suggests that for NIMBY facilities, legitimacy is built less through bureaucratic compliance and more through the everyday quality of interactions between project proponents and community members. The study also finds that public trust serves as a partial mediator: procedural justice builds trust, and trust in turn increases willingness to accept the facility.

## Background

The social license to operate (SLO) concept originated in the mining industry and refers to the ongoing acceptance of a project by local communities and stakeholders. Unlike formal permits, an SLO cannot be granted by a government agency -- it must be earned through relationships, communication, and perceived fairness. The authors integrate SLO theory with Colquitt's (2001) four-component model of procedural justice, which distinguishes between formal procedural features and the interpersonal dimensions of how people are treated during decision-making processes. The study contributes to a growing literature on how procedural justice can reduce opposition to infrastructure projects, particularly in China, where rapid urbanization and industrial development have generated significant NIMBY conflicts.

## Key Arguments

| Procedural Justice Component | What It Involves | Effect on SLO |
|---|---|---|
| Voice | Opportunities for affected residents to express concerns and provide input | Significant positive effect on trust and acceptance |
| Neutrality | Unbiased, consistent application of decision-making criteria | Significant positive effect, signals fairness of the process |
| Respect | Dignified, courteous treatment of community members by officials and enterprise | Significant positive effect; enterprise behavior matters most |
| Trustworthiness | Confidence that decision-makers act with good intentions | Significant positive effect; builds foundation for acceptance |
| Public trust (mediator) | Trust in both government and enterprise | Partially mediates the path from procedural justice to SLO |
| Government formal procedures | Official regulations and administrative compliance | Least influential of the four components |
| Enterprise informal treatment | Day-to-day behavior and attitudes of company toward residents | Most influential of the four components |

## Open Questions

- If enterprise behavior matters more than government procedures, should regulatory frameworks require specific standards for how project proponents engage with communities?
- Do these findings generalize beyond the Chinese institutional context, where government-community power dynamics may differ from those in liberal democracies?
- How do the four components of procedural justice interact with outcome fairness -- does fair process still build acceptance if residents believe the facility distribution is fundamentally unjust?
