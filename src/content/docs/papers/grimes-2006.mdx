**Domain:** Political trust and land use decisions (Sweden, railway modernization)

Most studies of procedural fairness and trust demonstrate a correlation: people who report fair treatment also report higher trust. But does fair treatment actually *cause* trust, or do trusting people simply perceive treatment as fairer? Grimes addresses this fundamental question using panel survey data from Swedish citizens affected by a major railway modernization project. By surveying the same individuals before and after they experienced the decision-making process, she can track how procedural fairness perceptions at one point in time predict changes in political trust and willingness to accept decisions at a later point. The result is one of the first studies to establish a causal -- not merely correlational -- effect of procedural fairness on both trust in authority and compliance with decisions, outside the United States.

The causal finding is significant because it closes a major gap in the procedural justice literature. If the relationship were merely correlational, the practical implications would be limited: you cannot easily make distrustful people more trusting. But if fair procedures causally produce trust, then institutional design matters enormously. Grimes shows that when Swedish citizens experienced the railway planning process as fair -- when they felt heard, informed, and treated respectfully -- their trust in the responsible authorities increased over time, and they became more willing to accept the outcome even when it was unfavorable to them. Conversely, when citizens experienced the process as unfair, their trust and compliance declined causally. This provides direct evidence that governments can build or erode their own legitimacy through the quality of the processes they run.

## Background

The study exploits the panel structure of surveys administered to residents in communities along a Swedish railway modernization corridor. The Bothnia Line project involved contentious land use decisions affecting multiple communities, providing a naturalistic setting for studying how real procedural experiences shape trust over time. Sweden's strong tradition of public consultation made the setting particularly instructive: even in a country with relatively high baseline institutional trust, procedural fairness perceptions significantly moved the needle.

## Key Arguments

| Hypothesis | Finding | Significance |
|---|---|---|
| Procedural fairness causally increases political trust | Confirmed: panel data shows fair treatment at T1 predicts increased trust at T2 | Establishes causation, not just correlation |
| Procedural fairness causally increases decision acceptance | Confirmed: fair process predicts greater willingness to accept unfavorable outcomes | Extends causal finding to compliance behavior |
| Unfair procedures causally decrease trust | Confirmed: perceived unfairness leads to measurable trust decline | Demonstrates the destructive power of procedural violations |
| Effect holds in a high-trust institutional context | Confirmed: significant effects even in Sweden | Generalizes beyond the US context |

## Open Questions

- Does the causal effect of procedural fairness on trust accumulate over repeated interactions, or is there a ceiling beyond which additional fairness has diminishing returns?
- How do individual differences in initial trust levels moderate the causal effect -- are the already-distrustful less responsive to fair treatment?
- Can the causal finding be replicated in low-trust institutional contexts where baseline expectations for fair process are lower?
