Jerry Mashaw's *Bureaucratic Justice* identified three competing models for how bureaucratic decisions should be made, using the Social Security disability system as a case study. The bureaucratic rationality model emphasizes accuracy and efficiency — making correct decisions at the lowest cost. The professional treatment model emphasizes expert judgment — giving trained professionals latitude to assess individual circumstances. The moral judgment model emphasizes fairness and individual rights — ensuring that each person receives due process and dignified treatment.

Mashaw's central insight is that these models are in fundamental tension with each other. Different stakeholders expect different things from the same bureaucratic system: administrators want efficiency, professionals want autonomy, and claimants want fairness. No single model can satisfy all legitimate demands simultaneously, and reforms aimed at one dimension of legitimacy (e.g., processing speed) often undermine another (e.g., perceived fairness or accuracy). This framework helps explain why bureaucratic justice is so difficult to achieve and why reforms often produce unintended consequences.

For procedural legitimacy, Mashaw's analysis reveals that the "right" bureaucratic process depends on which values are prioritized — and that the failure to acknowledge these trade-offs produces systems that satisfy no one. A disability claims process designed purely for efficiency will feel unfair; one designed purely for fairness will be slow and expensive. The legitimacy challenge is finding a balance that citizens, professionals, and administrators all find acceptable.

## Background

Mashaw studied the Social Security Administration's disability determination process, one of the largest adjudicatory systems in the world, processing millions of claims annually. He combined legal analysis with organizational theory to explain why a system designed to deliver fair outcomes so often fails to satisfy claimants, administrators, and courts.

## Key Arguments

| Model | Priority | Weakness |
|---|---|---|
| Bureaucratic rationality | Accuracy and efficiency | May sacrifice individual fairness for systemic optimization |
| Professional treatment | Expert judgment and individual assessment | Inconsistent across professionals; hard to review |
| Moral judgment | Due process and individual rights | Slow, expensive; may not produce accurate outcomes |

## Open Questions

- How should systems balance the three models when they conflict — who gets to decide which value takes priority?
- Has the rise of algorithmic decision-making effectively imposed the bureaucratic rationality model at the expense of the other two?
- Can participatory design processes help resolve the tension by involving multiple stakeholders in system design?
