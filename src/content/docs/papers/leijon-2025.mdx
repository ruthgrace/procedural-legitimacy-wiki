Leijon examined how courts constrain welfare bureaucrats' discretion in practice, using analysis of Swedish administrative court decisions. She found that judicial review can meaningfully limit street-level discretion — but only when courts apply substantive standards rather than merely deferring to agency expertise. The effectiveness of judicial constraint depends on the specificity of legal standards and the willingness of courts to engage with the substance of discretionary decisions rather than simply rubber-stamping agency outcomes.

Sweden provides an instructive case because its welfare system combines generous benefits with significant bureaucratic discretion in administration. Swedish administrative courts are more accessible than their American counterparts, allowing more frequent judicial review of individual welfare decisions. Leijon's analysis of how these courts handle discretionary welfare decisions reveals that the quality of judicial constraint varies enormously depending on whether courts engage substantively with the decision or defer to bureaucratic expertise.

For procedural legitimacy, Leijon's work shows that the mere existence of judicial review is not enough — what matters is how courts exercise their own review function. Deferential review provides little meaningful constraint on arbitrary discretion, while substantive engagement can discipline bureaucratic decision-making. This connects to Bressman's argument that the quality of oversight matters more than its formal existence.

## Background

The study analyzed decisions from Swedish administrative courts (förvaltningsdomstolar), which have jurisdiction over appeals from welfare agency decisions. Sweden's administrative court system is more accessible and faster than many other countries' judicial review mechanisms, providing a useful context for studying how courts interact with bureaucratic discretion.

## Key Arguments

| Finding | Implication |
|---|---|
| Courts can meaningfully constrain discretion | Judicial review is not inherently toothless |
| Substantive review matters | Courts must engage with the substance, not just the procedure |
| Deference undermines constraint | When courts defer to agency expertise, discretion goes unchecked |
| Specificity of standards matters | Clear legal standards enable more effective judicial review |
| Accessibility enables review | More accessible courts allow more cases to be reviewed |

## Open Questions

- How do different judicial traditions (common law vs. civil law) shape the effectiveness of discretion constraint?
- Can administrative court decisions create binding precedent that constrains future bureaucratic discretion?
- What is the optimal level of judicial engagement — enough to constrain arbitrariness without micromanaging agencies?
