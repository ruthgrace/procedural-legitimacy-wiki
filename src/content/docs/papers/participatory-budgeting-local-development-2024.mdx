**Domain:** Participatory budgeting, democratic governance, and local development (global)

Participatory budgeting (PB) -- the practice of allowing community members to directly decide how to allocate a portion of a public budget -- has been called one of the most ambitious participatory innovations of the last several decades. Originating in Porto Alegre, Brazil in 1989, PB has since spread to thousands of cities worldwide. Schugurensky and Mook take stock of this global experiment in their editorial introduction to a special issue of *Local Development & Society*, examining what PB has accomplished, what challenges it faces, and what prospects remain for deepening its impact on local development and democratic legitimacy.

The authors find that PB has produced real, measurable benefits. Participants develop civic and democratic competencies, acquire political skills, and experience a sense of empowerment when they see their engagement translate into tangible improvements in their communities. Communities that adopt PB often see shifts in spending priorities toward historically underserved populations and neighborhoods. However, the article also identifies persistent challenges: PB processes often operate with small budgets relative to overall municipal spending, raising questions about whether they represent genuine power-sharing or merely symbolic gestures. Turnout and representation remain uneven, with wealthier and better-educated residents often dominating the process despite the tool's egalitarian aspirations. The authors argue that PB's future depends on whether governments are willing to scale it up, protect it from political co-optation, and embed it within broader strategies for democratic renewal and local development.

## Background

Participatory budgeting emerged in the late 1980s as part of the Workers' Party's governance reforms in Porto Alegre, and quickly became an international model for democratic innovation. Schugurensky has been a leading researcher on PB's educational and democratic effects, arguing that one of the best ways to learn democracy is by doing it. This editorial introduction synthesizes findings from across the special issue, which includes studies of PB in diverse contexts including Argentina, the United States, Portugal, and Paris. The literature on PB intersects with procedural legitimacy in important ways: PB represents one of the most direct forms of citizen voice in government spending decisions, and its effectiveness hinges on whether participants perceive the process as genuinely fair and influential.

## Key Arguments

| Dimension | Impacts | Challenges |
|---|---|---|
| Democratic learning | Participants gain civic skills, political knowledge, and democratic values | Learning effects depend on quality of deliberation and facilitation |
| Resource allocation | Spending shifts toward underserved communities and populations | PB budgets are often a tiny fraction of total municipal spending |
| Empowerment | Citizens feel emboldened when their engagement makes a real difference | Power asymmetries between officials and participants persist |
| Inclusion | Designed to broaden who participates in budget decisions | Wealthier and more educated residents still overrepresented |
| Legitimacy | Builds trust and perceived fairness in government | Risk of co-optation -- PB used as symbolic gesture without real authority |
| Scalability | Thousands of cities globally have adopted some form of PB | Institutional sustainability is fragile; depends on political will |

## Open Questions

- Under what conditions does PB produce lasting shifts in government spending priorities, as opposed to one-time symbolic projects?
- How can digital PB platforms expand participation without exacerbating the digital divide and excluding those without internet access?
- Does the educational and democratic learning effect of PB carry over into other forms of civic engagement beyond budgeting?
