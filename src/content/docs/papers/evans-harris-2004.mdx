Evans and Harris challenged the widespread assumption that New Public Management reforms had successfully curtailed street-level discretion. Through analysis of managerial reforms in British social work, they argued that standardized procedures, performance targets, and audit regimes change the *form* of discretion but do not eliminate it. Workers find new spaces for judgment within and around formal constraints, and the attempt to control discretion through managerial oversight often merely shifts it to less visible domains.

This finding has important implications for procedural legitimacy. If tightening rules and adding oversight cannot eliminate discretion, then reforms focused solely on reducing discretionary authority will fail. Instead, institutions need to think about how to ensure that the discretion that inevitably exists is exercised in ways that are fair, consistent, and accountable. Evans and Harris suggest that the "death of discretion" narrative is not only empirically wrong but potentially harmful — it leads to reforms that create an illusion of control while the real exercise of discretion becomes harder to monitor and hold accountable.

## Background

The paper was written during the height of New Public Management reforms in British social services, when managerial techniques from the private sector were being applied to public agencies with the explicit goal of reducing professional autonomy and discretion. Evans and Harris drew on Lipsky's street-level bureaucracy framework to argue that these reforms were less successful than proponents claimed.

## Key Arguments

| Claim | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Discretion persists under managerial reforms | Workers reinterpret, adapt, and work around formal constraints |
| Rules create new discretionary spaces | Ambiguity in rules requires judgment; more rules create more interpretation |
| Managerial oversight shifts discretion | Discretion moves from visible to less visible domains |
| The "death of discretion" is exaggerated | Reports of its demise serve political purposes but lack empirical support |

## Open Questions

- If discretion cannot be eliminated, what institutional designs best ensure it is exercised fairly?
- How do digital systems and algorithmic tools change the dynamics Evans and Harris identified?
- Does making discretion visible (rather than trying to eliminate it) improve accountability?
