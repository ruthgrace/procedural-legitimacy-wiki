**Domain:** Corruption, economic crisis, and political fragmentation (Spain)

Corruption does not just damage trust in the moment — it creates lasting political vulnerability that manifests when other stresses hit. Sanz, Solé-Ollé, and Sorribas-Navarro study how Spain's Great Recession interacted with the legacy of local corruption scandals to produce political fragmentation. They find that local unemployment shocks during the recession led to increased political fragmentation (more parties, more vote dispersion), but this effect was **four times larger in municipalities with a prior history of corruption scandals**. Corruption acts as an accelerant: when economic crisis arrives, the pre-existing legitimacy deficit from corruption amplifies the political backlash.

This finding has significant implications for understanding institutional resilience. It suggests that corruption damages not only current trust but the capacity of institutions to weather future challenges. Municipalities that had maintained procedural legitimacy were better able to absorb economic shocks without political upheaval, while those with corruption histories saw the same shocks produce far more disruptive political consequences.

## Background

The study exploits variation across Spanish municipalities in both exposure to the Great Recession (measured by local unemployment increases) and history of corruption scandals (documented cases of local government corruption during the pre-crisis period). Spain provides an ideal setting because it experienced both a severe economic crisis and widespread local corruption during the 2000s real estate boom, with significant variation across municipalities on both dimensions. Sanz (Bank of Spain), Solé-Ollé (University of Barcelona), and Sorribas-Navarro (University of Barcelona) use electoral data from municipal elections to measure political fragmentation — the proliferation of parties and erosion of traditional party dominance — as an indicator of political disruption.

## Key Arguments

| Finding | Detail |
|---|---|
| Corruption amplifies recession effects | The political fragmentation caused by economic shocks was 4x larger in corruption-affected municipalities |
| Lasting vulnerability | Corruption created a pre-existing legitimacy deficit that magnified subsequent political disruption |
| Institutional resilience | Municipalities without corruption histories absorbed economic shocks with less political upheaval |
| Interaction effect | Neither corruption alone nor recession alone produced the same level of fragmentation — the combination was combustible |
| Implications for trust | The finding demonstrates that corruption damages institutional capacity to manage future crises |

## Open Questions

- Does the amplification effect also operate in reverse — can a strong procedural legitimacy record buffer institutions against the political effects of economic crisis?
- Is the amplification effect specific to corruption, or would other forms of institutional failure (incompetence, scandal) produce similar vulnerability?
- How do the new parties that emerge from corruption-amplified fragmentation differ in their governance practices from the traditional parties they displace?
