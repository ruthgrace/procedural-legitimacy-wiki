Brodkin demonstrated how welfare bureaucrats exercised discretion in ways that systematically undermined formal policy goals. Through fieldwork in Chicago welfare offices, she showed that caseworkers — operating under heavy caseloads and organizational pressure — developed informal practices for processing cases that diverged significantly from official procedures. The discretion exercised at the front lines effectively created a different policy than the one enacted by legislators, with outcomes shaped by organizational convenience rather than client need.

Brodkin's key insight is that street-level discretion is not random but structured by organizational conditions. When caseworkers face impossible caseloads, they develop shortcuts: categorizing clients quickly, prioritizing easy-to-process cases, and using informal screening criteria that may have little to do with formal eligibility standards. These organizational adaptations systematically affect who receives benefits, how they are treated, and whether policy goals are achieved.

For procedural legitimacy, Brodkin's work shows that formal procedures may look fair on paper while being systematically undermined in practice. The procedural fairness citizens experience depends not on the rules as written but on how organizational conditions shape the discretion of the workers who implement those rules. A fair-sounding welfare policy can produce unfair outcomes when the conditions of implementation encourage or require caseworkers to exercise discretion in biased ways.

## Background

Brodkin conducted ethnographic research in Chicago welfare offices during the implementation of welfare reform. Her work drew on both Lipsky's street-level bureaucracy framework and organizational theory to explain how and why frontline practices diverged from policy intent. The research was particularly significant because it documented how welfare reform — which aimed to increase accountability — actually created new forms of unaccountable discretion.

## Examples of Formal Procedures Being Systematically Undermined

Brodkin's ethnographic research documented several concrete ways that caseworkers in the Chicago JOBS (Job Opportunities and Basic Skills) program developed informal practices that diverged from official procedures:

**Routinized referrals replacing individualized assessments.** The JOBS program formally required caseworkers to conduct individualized assessments of each welfare recipient's circumstances, skills, and barriers to employment, and then match them to appropriate welfare-to-work services. In practice, Brodkin tracked a high-performing caseworker and found that during one week, every single client was referred to the same welfare-to-work provider — regardless of the diversity of their circumstances, skills, or needs. Further investigation revealed broad use of this "under the radar" shortcut across the office. As Brodkin observed, "it's easiest for a caseworker to send everybody to a provider who gets the paperwork done quickly." The formal individualized assessment was completed on paper, but the substance of the matching was eliminated.

**Speed over need.** Caseworkers facing heavy caseloads and participation quotas prioritized processing speed over service quality. The organizational imperative was to move clients through the system — complete the intake paperwork, record a referral, meet the participation count — not to spend time understanding each client's situation and finding the best match. Formal policy envisioned careful assessment leading to tailored services; the organizational reality incentivized rapid processing that treated every client as interchangeable.

**Creaming.** Caseworkers informally focused their effort on clients who were easiest to serve — those who were already close to employment-ready, had fewer barriers, and would produce quick success statistics. Clients with more complex needs (mental health issues, substance abuse, domestic violence, lack of transportation or childcare) received less attention and less thoughtful referrals, because serving them required more time and was less likely to produce measurable outcomes. The formal policy made no distinction between easy and hard cases, but the organizational pressure to meet numbers encouraged caseworkers to prioritize the clients most likely to count as successes.

**Paper compliance without substantive compliance.** Caseworkers became skilled at completing the required documentation — assessment forms, service plans, referral records — in ways that satisfied formal requirements while the underlying substance of the work diverged from policy intent. Forms were filled out, boxes were checked, and records showed that procedures were followed, but the actual decisions being made bore little resemblance to what the documentation implied. Brodkin identified this as the "missing middle" — the opaque space between formal policy provisions and actual social outcomes where the real work of the welfare state takes place, largely invisible to supervisors and policymakers.

**Organizational narratives replacing individual judgment.** Caseworkers developed shared informal scripts and categories for sorting clients that simplified decision-making but overrode clients' rights to individualized treatment. Rather than engaging with the specifics of each case, workers applied routine categorizations — "she's a typical case," "he's not really trying" — that determined the level of effort and flexibility a client received. These collective cues reduced the cognitive burden of casework but meant that many clients received standardized treatment dressed up as individualized assessment.

## Key Arguments

| Finding | Implication |
|---|---|
| Informal practices diverge from formal rules | Policy as experienced differs from policy as designed |
| Organizational conditions structure discretion | Heavy caseloads, pressure, and resource scarcity shape how discretion is exercised |
| Discretion undermines policy goals | Caseworker shortcuts systematically affect who benefits from policy |
| Accountability paradox | Reforms aimed at accountability create new unaccountable practices |
| Organizational convenience over client need | Processing efficiency becomes the primary driver of decisions |

## Open Questions

- How can welfare systems be designed to align organizational incentives with policy goals and client needs?
- Does reducing caseloads meaningfully improve the quality of discretionary decisions?
- Can technology help identify when informal practices are systematically diverging from formal policy?
