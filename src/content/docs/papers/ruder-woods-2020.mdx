Administrative agencies in the United States wield enormous power through rulemaking — issuing regulations that have the force of law without direct legislative action. This power raises a fundamental legitimacy question: on what basis should citizens accept rules made by unelected bureaucrats? Ruder and Woods tackle this question by testing whether the perceived fairness of the rulemaking process itself generates legitimacy for agency rules. Using a survey experiment, they find that transparency and citizen-participation procedures do increase perceptions of legitimacy — but the effect is not unconditional.

The key finding is that procedural fairness in rulemaking has a real but context-dependent effect on legitimacy. Citizens who learn that a rule was developed through an open, participatory process are more likely to view it as legitimate than those who learn it was developed behind closed doors. However, the strength of this effect varies across policy domains and is moderated by citizens' prior attitudes toward the policy area. This suggests that procedural legitimacy is not a magic bullet that can resolve deep substantive disagreements — but it is a meaningful component of how citizens evaluate administrative authority.

The paper is one of the few to directly test procedural justice theory in the specific context of administrative rulemaking, bridging the gap between social psychology (which studies fairness perceptions) and administrative law (which designs procedural requirements for agencies).

## Background

The study is situated within debates about the "democratic deficit" of administrative agencies. The Administrative Procedure Act (1946) requires agencies to follow notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures, but there has been little empirical evidence about whether these procedures actually generate legitimacy in the eyes of citizens.

## Key Arguments

| Procedural Feature | Effect on Perceived Legitimacy |
|---|---|
| Transparency (open process) | Increases perceived legitimacy |
| Citizen participation (public comment) | Increases perceived legitimacy |
| Policy domain | Moderates the effect — procedural fairness matters more in some domains |
| Prior attitudes | Citizens skeptical of the policy area are less responsive to procedural fairness cues |

The authors conclude that procedural fairness is a real but partial source of legitimacy for agency rulemaking — necessary but not sufficient on its own.

## Open Questions

- Should agencies invest more in meaningful public participation (beyond pro forma comment periods) to bolster legitimacy?
- How do negotiations and lobbying by organized interests affect public perceptions of rulemaking fairness?
- Does the legitimacy effect of fair procedures decay over time, or does it persist as rules are implemented?
