Kenneth Culp Davis's *Discretionary Justice* made the foundational legal case for constraining administrative discretion. Davis argued that unchecked discretion is the principal source of injustice in the American legal system — not because discretion is inherently wrong, but because its exercise without adequate safeguards invites arbitrariness, favoritism, and inconsistency. Writing at a time when administrative agencies were rapidly expanding their power, Davis showed that the vast majority of government decisions affecting individual citizens were made not by courts or legislatures but by bureaucrats exercising discretionary authority with minimal oversight.

Davis proposed a framework of "confining, structuring, and checking" discretion. Confining means setting clear outer boundaries on what discretion can be exercised. Structuring means requiring decision-makers to articulate standards and follow procedures. Checking means providing meaningful review by supervisors, courts, or other oversight bodies. This framework remains the intellectual foundation for legal efforts to constrain bureaucratic power and ensure that administrative decisions are reasoned, consistent, and fair.

The book's core insight — that justice requires not just good rules but constraints on discretionary power — connects directly to procedural legitimacy. A system that grants broad discretion without accountability mechanisms cannot deliver procedural fairness, because citizens cannot predict how they will be treated or hold decision-makers responsible for arbitrary action.

## Background

Davis wrote from the perspective of administrative law during the expansion of the American regulatory state. He drew on extensive case studies of prosecutorial discretion, police discretion, and administrative agency decision-making to document the pervasiveness of unchecked discretionary power. His work influenced subsequent generations of administrative law scholarship and reform.

## Key Arguments

| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| Unnecessary discretion | Much discretion exists not because it's needed but because no one has bothered to constrain it |
| Confining discretion | Setting clear outer limits on the scope of discretionary authority |
| Structuring discretion | Requiring standards, findings, and articulated reasons for decisions |
| Checking discretion | Providing meaningful review through supervisors, courts, or oversight bodies |
| Selective enforcement | The power to decide *not* to enforce is as significant as the power to act |

## Open Questions

- Has the growth of algorithmic decision-making created new forms of unchecked discretion that Davis's framework doesn't address?
- Can Davis's confine-structure-check framework be adapted to constrain the discretion exercised through administrative burden and process design?
- How do different legal traditions approach the problem of constraining administrative discretion?
