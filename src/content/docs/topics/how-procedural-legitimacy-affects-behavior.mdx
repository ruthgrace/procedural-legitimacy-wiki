title: "How Procedural Legitimacy Affects Behavior"
description: "How perceptions of procedural fairness shape compliance, cooperation, retaliation, and civic engagement in both corporate and government contexts."
---

One of the most consistently replicated findings in the procedural justice literature is that fair processes change what people *do*, not just how they feel. When individuals perceive that they have been treated fairly by an authority — whether an employer, a tax office, or a city inspector — they are more likely to comply voluntarily, cooperate with future requests, and refrain from retaliatory behavior. Conversely, perceived procedural unfairness predicts resistance, non-compliance, disengagement, and even active retaliation. This section collects research on the behavioral consequences of procedural legitimacy across corporate and government settings.

The behavioral effects are not limited to the immediate interaction. Procedural fairness (or unfairness) shapes how people approach *future* encounters with the same authority. A taxpayer who feels fairly treated during an audit is more likely to file honestly the next year. An employee who perceives an unfair promotion process may begin withholding effort or looking for a new job. A citizen who encounters a dismissive bureaucrat may disengage from civic participation entirely. The behavioral ripple effects of procedural legitimacy extend well beyond the moment of the encounter.

## Corporate and Organizational

In the workplace, procedural justice has been shown to predict a wide range of employee behaviors. [Colquitt et al. (2001)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/colquitt-et-al-2001/) established through meta-analysis that procedural justice is among the strongest predictors of organizational commitment and rule compliance. [Konovsky (2000)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/konovsky-2000/) reviewed the mechanisms by which fair processes affect employee behavior, identifying self-interest, group value, and fairness heuristic pathways. [Skarlicki & Folger (1997)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/skarlicki-folger-1997/) demonstrated the dark side: when distributive, procedural, and interactional justice are all perceived as low, employees engage in retaliatory behaviors including sabotage, theft, and deliberate slowdowns.

On the customer-facing side, [Blodgett, Hill & Tax (1997)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/blodgett-et-al-1997/) showed that how a product return is handled — the courtesy, speed, and fairness of the process — predicts whether customers come back or spread negative word-of-mouth. [Maxham & Netemeyer (2003)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/maxham-netemeyer-2003/) traced the causal chain further, showing that internal organizational justice cascades through employee behavior to affect customer experiences and ultimately customer loyalty.

[Rorie et al. (2018)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/rorie-et-al-2018/) extended the behavioral findings to the corporate level, demonstrating that firms that perceive environmental regulators as procedurally fair are more likely not only to comply with minimum legal standards but to engage in "beyond-compliance" behavior — voluntarily exceeding regulatory requirements.

## Government

In government contexts, the behavioral effects of procedural legitimacy are equally pronounced. [Murphy (2005)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/murphy-2005/) demonstrated that taxpayers who perceive the Australian Taxation Office as procedurally unfair are more likely to resist compliance, even when they accept the legitimacy of the tax obligation itself. [Wenzel (2006)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/wenzel-2006/) provided causal evidence through a field experiment: government letters designed to embody informational and interpersonal fairness produced significantly higher tax filing rates than standard bureaucratic reminders. [Hartner et al. (2008)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/hartner-et-al-2008/) found that procedurally unfair treatment by tax authorities erodes compliance most among the taxpayers who were previously most willing to contribute.

[Levi & Sacks (2009)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/levi-sacks-2009/) modeled this at the cross-national level, showing that procedural justice and government trustworthiness jointly produce "behavioral legitimacy" — actual compliance with taxes and regulations — across multiple African nations.

At the local government level, [Nielsen, Nielsen & Bisgaard (2021)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/nielsen-et-al-2021/) identified five distinct behavioral coping strategies citizens adopt after bureaucratic encounters, from cooperation to resistance to total disengagement, with procedural unfairness predicting the more destructive responses. [de Boer (2021)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/de-boer-2021/) added nuance by finding that in one-shot encounters typical of local code enforcement, the inspector's enforcement style has surprisingly limited influence on compliance — suggesting that systemic design may matter more than individual interactions. [Weigel (2020)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/weigel-2020/) provided striking evidence from a field experiment in Congo that even the act of collecting property taxes can increase civic participation and perceptions of government legitimacy, suggesting that administrative encounters can build rather than erode engagement.

[van Dijke, Gobena & Verboon (2019)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/tax-compliance-three-way-interaction-2019/) found that procedural and distributive justice can substitute for each other in driving voluntary tax compliance, but only when authority power is perceived as high. Across Ethiopian and US samples, this three-way interaction suggests that fair process matters most for compliance when the authority is seen as powerful enough to enforce its decisions.

[Msenge & Nzewi (2021)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/msenge-citizen-participation-south-africa/) found that procedural exclusion from municipal decision-making drives service delivery protests in South Africa. When citizens perceive no meaningful channel through which to influence local government decisions, they resort to protest as the only available mechanism — a direct behavioral consequence of procedural illegitimacy.

Corruption represents a particularly destructive form of procedural violation with behavioral consequences that extend beyond trust. [Villoria, Van Ryzin & Lavena (2013)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/villoria-van-ryzin-lavena-2013/) found that citizens who perceived more corruption in Spanish local government reported not only lower institutional trust but greater willingness to break rules themselves — creating a feedback loop in which institutional wrongdoing erodes the normative commitment to rule-following among the public.

[Devine-Wright (2013)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/devine-wright-nimby-2013/) and [Feng et al. (2024)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/nimby-procedural-justice-2024/) examined how procedural justice perceptions shape community responses to infrastructure siting. Devine-Wright showed that opposition to a power line was driven not only by place attachment but independently by procedural justice perceptions. Feng et al. found that all four components of procedural justice help build social acceptance for NIMBY facilities, with enterprise behavior mattering more than government formal procedures in shaping whether communities oppose or accept local siting decisions.
