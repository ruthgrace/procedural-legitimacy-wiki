title: "Fairness and Justice"
description: "The conceptual foundations of organizational and procedural justice — what fairness means, how to measure it, and the dimensions that matter."

Before asking whether procedural legitimacy affects behavior or trust, a prior question must be answered: what *is* procedural justice, and how does it relate to other forms of fairness? This section collects foundational research that defines the conceptual landscape — distinguishing procedural justice from distributive, interpersonal, and informational justice, developing measurement instruments, and debating whether procedural fairness alone is sufficient for justice.

The field has converged on a multi-dimensional view of justice. People evaluate fairness along several independent dimensions, and each dimension predicts different outcomes. Understanding these dimensions — and the tensions between them — is essential for applying procedural legitimacy to any specific context, whether corporate or governmental.

## Corporate and Organizational

[Greenberg (1987)](/papers/greenberg-1987/) provided the foundational taxonomy that organized scattered research on workplace fairness into a coherent field. His two-dimensional framework — crossing a reactive-proactive dimension with a process-content dimension — established "organizational justice" as a unified domain and highlighted the distinction between procedural justice (fairness of processes) and distributive justice (fairness of outcomes).

[Colquitt (2001)](/papers/colquitt-2001/) built on this by providing definitive empirical evidence for a four-factor structure of organizational justice: distributive, procedural, interpersonal, and informational. The validated measure demonstrated that each dimension predicts different workplace outcomes — procedural justice predicts organizational commitment and rule compliance, distributive justice predicts pay satisfaction, and interpersonal and informational justice predict evaluations of supervisors. This four-factor model became the standard measurement instrument in the field.

[Folger & Konovsky (1989)](/papers/folger-konovsky-1989/) established one of the most robust findings in the literature: procedural and distributive justice have distinct predictive profiles. Fair processes predict loyalty and trust in the institution; fair outcomes predict satisfaction with the specific decision. This distinction has held across hundreds of subsequent studies.

In the context of labor relations, [Cloutier, Denis & Bilodeau (2012)](/papers/cloutier-et-al-2012/) showed that justice in collective bargaining has *eight* distinct dimensions — combining the four justice types with two independent sources of (in)justice (employer and union). Workers evaluate the fairness of both the employer's and the union's conduct independently. [Cloutier & Denis (2013)](/papers/cloutier-denis-2013/) extended this by showing that the relative importance of different justice dimensions shifts across the lifecycle of a labor dispute — distributive concerns dominate early on, while procedural and informational concerns become more salient as a strike progresses.

## Government

[Campbell (2006)](/papers/campbell-2006/) offered an important critique of the procedural turn in planning theory. She argued that planning justice requires more than fair procedures — it demands "situated ethical judgment," the ability of planners to engage with substantive questions about what constitutes a good outcome. A zoning board that runs a flawless public hearing but approves a development that concentrates harms on a low-income neighborhood has not achieved justice. This challenges the view that procedural fairness alone can legitimate government decisions, and argues that procedural and substantive justice must be pursued together.

[Selmi (2017)](/papers/degradation-zoning-fairness/) provides a concrete case study of Campbell's concern. Selmi documents how municipal zoning has degraded from quasi-judicial proceedings — with notice requirements, evidentiary standards, and reasoned decisions — into politically driven processes where outcomes reflect neighborhood pressure rather than principled application of criteria. This challenges the assumption that procedural safeguards, once established, are maintained over time.

The rise of algorithmic decision-making introduces new dimensions to the fairness debate. [Kinchin (2024)](/papers/voiceless-algorithmic-justice-2024/) identifies a fundamental "voice" deficit in algorithmic governance — automated systems make consequential decisions while stripping away the procedural safeguards (hearings, explanations, appeals) that traditional processes provide. [Leicht-Scholten et al. (2024)](/papers/algorithmic-fairness-public-engagement-2024/) extends this critique by arguing that the technical fairness metrics dominating the algorithmic fairness literature address distributional outcomes but neglect procedural fairness, and that genuine public engagement is necessary to bridge the gap.

The tension Campbell identifies — between process and substance — runs throughout the procedural legitimacy literature in government contexts. Fair process is widely acknowledged as necessary, but the debate over whether it is *sufficient* remains unresolved.
