title: "Bureaucratic Discretion, Abuse, and Exclusion"
description: "How bureaucratic discretion — inherent in all administration — creates conditions for abuse, discrimination, and exclusion, particularly in welfare and land use."
---

Discretion is inherent in administration. Policies cannot anticipate every case, rules require interpretation, and frontline workers must make judgment calls about how to apply general mandates to specific situations. This discretion is often necessary and even beneficial — rigid rule application can produce absurd or unjust outcomes. But discretion also creates conditions for abuse, bias, and arbitrary action. When a building inspector decides which violations to cite, when a welfare caseworker determines whether an applicant has "sufficiently" documented their need, when a zoning board votes to deny a housing project, each exercises discretion that shapes people's lives in ways that may or may not reflect the intent of the underlying policy.

The procedural legitimacy question at the heart of this literature is: what makes discretion legitimate rather than abusive? The research reviewed here suggests that legitimacy requires constraining discretion through clear standards, accountability mechanisms, and genuine oversight — while recognizing that discretion can never be fully eliminated. The tension between necessary flexibility and the risk of arbitrary power runs through every domain of public administration, from welfare offices to zoning boards to regulatory agencies.

## The Nature of Bureaucratic Discretion

The foundational framework for understanding bureaucratic discretion comes from [Michael Lipsky's *Street-Level Bureaucracy* (1980)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/lipsky-1980/), which demonstrated that frontline public workers — teachers, police officers, social workers, welfare caseworkers — inevitably exercise substantial discretion in their daily work. Lipsky showed that the gap between policy as written and policy as implemented is not a bug but a structural feature of public administration. Street-level bureaucrats must make decisions about how to allocate scarce resources, how to interpret ambiguous rules, and how to balance competing demands — and these decisions, aggregated across thousands of interactions, effectively *become* the policy that citizens experience. This insight reframed the study of public policy from a top-down focus on legislation and executive orders to a bottom-up analysis of how policy is actually delivered.

[Kenneth Culp Davis's *Discretionary Justice* (1969)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/davis-1969/) made the legal case for constraining administrative discretion. Writing from an administrative law perspective, Davis argued that unchecked discretion is the principal source of injustice in the American legal system — not because discretion is inherently wrong, but because its exercise without adequate safeguards invites arbitrariness, favoritism, and inconsistency. Davis proposed a framework of "confining, structuring, and checking" discretion through clearer standards, required findings, and meaningful review. His work remains the intellectual foundation for legal efforts to constrain bureaucratic power.

[Jerry Mashaw's *Bureaucratic Justice* (1983)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/mashaw-1983/) identified three competing models for how bureaucratic decisions should be made: a bureaucratic rationality model (emphasizing accuracy and efficiency), a professional treatment model (emphasizing expert judgment), and a moral judgment model (emphasizing fairness and individual rights). Mashaw argued that the tension between these models explains many of the legitimacy problems in administrative decision-making — different stakeholders expect different things from the same bureaucratic system, and no single model can satisfy all legitimate demands simultaneously. His framework helps explain why reforms aimed at one dimension of legitimacy (e.g., efficiency) can undermine another (e.g., perceived fairness).

[Tony Evans and John Harris (2004)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/evans-harris-2004/) challenged the assumption that New Public Management reforms successfully curtailed street-level discretion. They argued that managerial techniques — standardized procedures, performance targets, audit regimes — change the *form* of discretion but do not eliminate it. Workers find new spaces for judgment within and around formal constraints, and the attempt to control discretion through managerial oversight often merely shifts it to less visible domains. This finding is important because it suggests that procedural reforms focused solely on tightening rules will not solve the legitimacy problems associated with discretion.

[Peter Hupe, Michael Hill, and Aurélien Buffat's edited volume *Understanding Street-Level Bureaucracy* (2015)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/hupe-hill-buffat-2015/) provides a comprehensive contemporary reference, synthesizing decades of research on how frontline discretion operates across different national contexts and policy domains.

## When Discretion Becomes Abuse

[Guy Adams and Danny Balfour's *Unmasking Administrative Evil* (first published 1998, third edition 2015)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/adams-balfour-2015/) introduced the concept of "administrative evil" — the capacity of ordinary people working within bureaucratic systems to contribute to harmful, even catastrophic, outcomes without recognizing the moral implications of their actions. Adams and Balfour argue that the technical-rational culture of modern organizations can mask the ethical dimensions of administrative action, allowing bureaucrats to participate in harmful policies by reframing moral questions as technical ones. While their most dramatic examples involve historical atrocities, their framework applies broadly: the same organizational dynamics that enabled large-scale administrative evil operate, in attenuated form, in everyday bureaucratic settings where discretion produces unjust outcomes.

[Steven Koven's *Administrative Evil, Street-Level Bureaucrats, and Public Policy* (2024)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/koven-2024/) extends Adams and Balfour's framework by connecting it directly to street-level discretion. Through case studies ranging from welfare administration to immigration enforcement, Koven shows how the conditions of frontline work — heavy caseloads, ambiguous rules, organizational pressure, and emotional distance from policy consequences — create environments where harmful discretion becomes normalized. The book argues that administrative evil is not confined to extreme historical episodes but is an ongoing risk embedded in the routine operations of government.

[Steven Maynard-Moody and Michael Musheno's *Cops, Teachers, Counselors* (2003)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/maynard-moody-musheno-2003/) provided rich ethnographic evidence of how street-level bureaucrats actually exercise discretion. Their central finding is that frontline workers make decisions based not on formal rules or organizational priorities but on moral judgments about the "worthiness" of the citizens they serve. Workers routinely distinguish between clients they perceive as deserving and those they view as undeserving, and allocate effort, flexibility, and resources accordingly. This finding has profound implications for procedural legitimacy: if discretion is exercised based on subjective moral assessments rather than consistent standards, then the procedural fairness of bureaucratic encounters depends heavily on whether the citizen is judged "worthy" by the worker they happen to face.

## Discriminatory Discretion

[Evelyn Brodkin's "Inside the Welfare Contract" (1997)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/brodkin-1997/) demonstrated how welfare bureaucrats exercised discretion in ways that systematically undermined formal policy goals. Through fieldwork in Chicago welfare offices, Brodkin showed that caseworkers — operating under heavy caseloads and organizational pressure — developed informal practices for processing cases that diverged significantly from official procedures. The discretion exercised at the front lines effectively created a different policy than the one enacted by legislators, with outcomes shaped by organizational convenience rather than client need. Brodkin's work established that street-level discretion is not random but structured by organizational conditions.

[Zachary Oberfield and Matthew Incantalupo (2021)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/oberfield-incantalupo-2021/) provided experimental evidence that bureaucratic discretion can produce racial discrimination. Using a randomized audit study, they showed that street-level bureaucrats treated citizens differently based on race — with disparities in responsiveness, helpfulness, and the information provided. This finding is important because it demonstrates that discriminatory discretion is not merely a product of individual prejudice but can emerge systematically from the conditions of bureaucratic work, even among workers who may not consciously intend to discriminate.

[Nienke Raaphorst and Sandra Groeneveld (2018)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/raaphorst-groeneveld-2018/) examined how street-level bureaucrats apply different standards when interacting with citizens from different social groups. Their research on Dutch tax inspectors found that bureaucrats used different "frames" for evaluating compliance depending on the social characteristics of the taxpayer, effectively creating a two-tier system of enforcement. Citizens from higher-status groups received more favorable assumptions about their intent and compliance, while those from lower-status groups faced greater scrutiny and suspicion.

[Celeste Watkins-Hayes's "Race, Respect, and Red Tape" (2011)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/watkins-hayes-2011/) explored how race shapes the experience of welfare bureaucracy. Through qualitative research in welfare offices, Watkins-Hayes showed that racial dynamics permeate bureaucratic encounters in ways that go beyond formal discrimination — affecting the tone of interactions, the amount of information shared, the flexibility offered, and the overall experience of dignity or degradation. Her work demonstrates that discretion operates not only through formal decisions (approve or deny) but through the interactional quality of bureaucratic encounters, connecting directly to the procedural justice dimensions of voice, respect, and dignified treatment.

[Sagi Gershgoren and Nissim Cohen (2023)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/gershgoren-cohen-2023/) examined factors related to street-level bureaucrats' tendencies to favor the state or citizens, treating Israeli lower-court judges as street-level bureaucrats. Analyzing rulings in civil tax disputes, they found that expanded discretionary space and formal certification as state servants were associated with pro-state favoritism, while appealability and mixed panels with lay officials promoted more citizen-friendly outcomes. This finding challenges the assumption that more discretion necessarily benefits citizens and suggests that the direction of discretionary bias depends on structural and organizational features of the decision-making environment.

## Administrative Burden as Structural Discretion

[Pamela Herd and Donald Moynihan's *Administrative Burden* (2018)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/herd-moynihan-2018/) reframed the entire discussion of bureaucratic discretion by arguing that administrative burdens — complex application processes, documentation requirements, waiting periods, confusing rules — are not accidental byproducts of bureaucracy but deliberate policy choices. By making it difficult to access benefits or exercise rights, governments exercise a form of structural discretion that does not depend on individual bureaucrats making biased decisions. Instead, the system itself screens out those who lack the resources, knowledge, or persistence to navigate bureaucratic obstacles. This form of discretion is particularly insidious because it appears neutral on its face while disproportionately affecting marginalized populations.

Herd and Moynihan distinguish three types of administrative burden: learning costs (figuring out what programs exist and how to apply), compliance costs (gathering documentation and completing procedures), and psychological costs (the stigma, stress, and frustration of engaging with bureaucracy). Each type operates as a filter that reduces access to public benefits, with the heaviest effects falling on those who are already disadvantaged. The procedural legitimacy implications are stark: a system that is formally open to all but practically accessible only to those with significant social capital cannot claim procedural fairness.

This connects to research already covered in this wiki. [Tummers et al. (2016)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/tummers-et-al-2016/) showed that bureaucratic red tape directly undermines citizens' perceptions of government legitimacy and willingness to comply. [Nielsen et al. (2021)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/nielsen-et-al-2021/) documented how citizens respond to burdensome bureaucratic encounters through resistance, flight, and other coping strategies — responses that can be understood as reactions to the procedural unfairness embedded in administrative burden.

## Land Use Discretion and Exclusion

Land use regulation is one of the most consequential domains of bureaucratic discretion in American government. Zoning boards, planning commissions, and city councils routinely make discretionary decisions about what can be built where — decisions that determine housing supply, neighborhood composition, property values, and access to opportunity. A substantial body of research documents how this discretion has been systematically used to enforce segregation and exclusion.

[William Fischel's "An Economic History of Zoning and a Cure for Its Exclusionary Effects" (2004)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/fischel-2004/) traced how homeowners became the dominant force in local land use politics. Fischel argued that because a home is most families' largest asset and homeowners cannot diversify against declines in home value, they have powerful incentives to use the political process to restrict development that might reduce property values. Zoning became the primary tool for this protection, and the discretionary nature of zoning decisions gave organized homeowners effective veto power over new development. The result is a systematic pattern of exclusionary zoning that restricts housing supply, inflates prices, and reinforces economic and racial segregation.

[Jessica Trounstine's *Segregation by Design* (2018)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/trounstine-2018/) provided a sweeping historical account of how local land use discretion has enforced segregation in American cities for over a century. Trounstine documents how local governments used zoning, infrastructure investment, annexation, and other discretionary tools to create and maintain racially and economically segregated communities. Critically, she shows that these patterns were not accidental or solely the product of private discrimination — they were the deliberate result of public policy choices made through discretionary governmental processes. The procedural mechanisms through which these decisions were made — closed meetings, selective enforcement, manipulation of boundaries — represent some of the most consequential procedural legitimacy failures in American governance.

[Katherine Levine Einstein, David Glick, and Maxwell Palmer's *Neighborhood Defenders* (2020)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/einstein-glick-palmer-2020/) provided systematic empirical evidence of who actually participates in local land use decisions. Through analysis of public hearing testimony across Massachusetts communities, they found that participants in land use meetings are overwhelmingly older, whiter, more affluent, and more likely to be homeowners than the broader community. These "neighborhood defenders" consistently oppose new housing development, and their outsized influence in participatory processes produces outcomes that restrict housing supply and exclude newcomers. Einstein, Glick, and Palmer demonstrate that participatory land use processes have been effectively captured by exclusionary interests — making the process itself a tool of exclusion rather than inclusion.

[Rolf Pendall's "Local Land Use Regulation and the Chain of Exclusion" (2000)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/pendall-2000/) mapped the systematic relationship between land use regulatory tools and exclusionary outcomes. Pendall showed that certain regulatory mechanisms — large-lot zoning, limits on multifamily housing, caps on building permits — form a "chain of exclusion" that restricts housing affordability and racial diversity. The discretion embedded in each link of this chain allows local governments to achieve exclusionary outcomes while maintaining the appearance of neutral regulation.

[Michael Lens and Paavo Monkkonen's review of the literature on exclusionary land use regulation (2022)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/lens-monkkonen-2022/) synthesized evidence across economics, planning, law, and political science. They documented the growing scholarly consensus that local land use regulation constrains housing supply, inflates prices, and contributes to segregation — with discretionary approval processes playing a central role in enabling these outcomes.

This literature connects directly to existing wiki entries. [Selmi (2017)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/degradation-zoning-fairness/) documented the degradation of procedural fairness in municipal zoning as decisions shifted from quasi-judicial proceedings with formal safeguards to ad hoc political processes. [Lemar (2021)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/overparticipation-land-use/) argued that land use participation suffers from overparticipation by unrepresentative nearby homeowners, proposing reforms modeled on federal rulemaking to broaden participation.

## Legal Constraints on Arbitrary Discretion

[Lisa Schultz Bressman's "Beyond Accountability: Arbitrariness and Legitimacy in the Administrative State" (2003)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/bressman-2003/) made a foundational argument that arbitrariness — not just accountability — is the core legitimacy problem in administrative law. Bressman argued that the traditional focus on whether agencies are accountable to elected officials misses the more fundamental question of whether agency decisions are arbitrary. An agency can be politically accountable and still exercise discretion in ways that are inconsistent, unprincipled, and unfair. Her framework shifts the legitimacy inquiry from "who controls the agency?" to "are the agency's decisions reasoned and consistent?"

[Bressman extended this analysis in "Judicial Review of Agency Inaction" (2004)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/bressman-2004/), arguing that agencies can abuse discretion not only through affirmative action but through strategic inaction — declining to enforce rules, delaying implementation, or ignoring statutory mandates. This form of abuse is particularly difficult to challenge because courts have traditionally been reluctant to review agency decisions not to act. Bressman argued that judicial review of inaction is necessary to prevent agencies from effectively repealing statutes through non-enforcement.

[Thomas Miles and Cass Sunstein's "The Real World of Arbitrariness Review" (2008)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/miles-sunstein-2008/) examined how courts actually review agency discretion under the "arbitrary and capricious" standard. Their empirical analysis revealed a troubling finding: judicial review itself is politicized, with judges appointed by different presidents reaching systematically different conclusions about whether agency actions are arbitrary. This means that the legal check on bureaucratic discretion is itself subject to ideological bias, complicating the assumption that judicial review provides a neutral constraint on arbitrary action.

[Marlene Leijon (2025)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/leijon-2025/) examined how courts constrain welfare bureaucrats' discretion in practice. Through analysis of Swedish administrative court decisions, Leijon showed that judicial review can meaningfully limit street-level discretion — but only when courts apply substantive standards rather than merely deferring to agency expertise. The effectiveness of judicial constraint depends on the specificity of legal standards and the willingness of courts to engage with the substance of discretionary decisions.

## Accountability and Reform

If discretion creates risks of abuse, how can institutions maintain accountability while preserving the flexibility that administration requires? Recent research offers several perspectives.

[Alissa Bernstein and María Rodriguez's "How Street-Level Bureaucrats Are Held Accountable" (2023)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/bernstein-rodriguez-2023/) examined the actual mechanisms through which frontline workers face consequences for their discretionary decisions. They found that accountability operates through multiple channels — supervisory oversight, peer norms, client complaints, legal requirements, and professional standards — and that these channels interact in complex ways. The effectiveness of accountability depends not on any single mechanism but on the overall configuration of oversight structures. Importantly, they found that excessive accountability pressure can itself be counterproductive, leading workers to prioritize documentation over service quality and to exercise discretion in ways that minimize personal risk rather than serve client interests.

[Laura Rivera and Dean Knox (2023)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/rivera-knox-2023/) highlighted a fundamental tension in reform efforts: discretion can be a tool for both equity and inequity. In some contexts, bureaucrats use discretion to help marginalized populations navigate rigid systems — exercising flexibility that formal rules would not permit. Eliminating discretion in the name of consistency could therefore harm the very populations that reforms aim to protect. Rivera and Knox argue that the legitimacy of discretion depends not on its existence but on the direction and consistency of its exercise.

[Sean Young and Susannah Tanner (2023)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/young-tanner-2023/) found that in practice, bureaucratic discretion dominates over citizen participation in shaping policy outcomes. Through a study of local governance, they showed that even in systems with formal participation mechanisms, the decisions that most affect citizens' lives are made through the exercise of bureaucratic discretion rather than through participatory processes. This finding underscores the importance of constraining discretion — since it is the primary mechanism through which policy is actually implemented, it is where procedural legitimacy efforts should focus.

[Kenneth Eckstein (2022)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/eckstein-2022/) offered a framework for when discretion can be legitimate. Drawing on deliberative democratic theory, Eckstein argued that discretion is legitimate when it is exercised transparently, when the reasons for decisions are articulated and subject to challenge, and when affected parties have meaningful opportunities to contest discretionary outcomes. Under this framework, the problem is not discretion itself but unaccountable discretion — decisions made without explanation, review, or recourse.

[Adam Molnar (2021)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/molnar-2021/) examined how new forms of regulation — particularly the outsourcing of regulatory functions to private actors and the use of algorithmic decision-making — create new forms of discretion that existing accountability mechanisms are poorly equipped to address. In the era of "regulatory capitalism," discretion is exercised not only by government bureaucrats but by private contractors, automated systems, and public-private partnerships that operate outside traditional oversight structures.
