title: "Trust and Perception of Procedural Legitimacy"
description: "How procedural fairness shapes trust in institutions, and what drives perceptions of fairness in the first place."

Procedural legitimacy is both an input and an output. Fair processes build trust in institutions, and trust in institutions shapes whether people interpret processes as fair. This section collects research on the relationship between procedural fairness and trust — both how fair treatment generates trust and what specific features of processes drive perceptions of fairness. It spans both directions of the causal arrow: what procedural legitimacy *produces* (trust) and what *produces* procedural legitimacy (transparency, voice, respect, explanation).

Understanding the drivers of perceived fairness is especially practical. If we know that citizens care about voice, transparency, and explanation, then institutions can be redesigned to deliver those features — even when the underlying decisions remain constrained.

## Corporate and Organizational

[Konovsky (2000)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/konovsky-2000/) reviewed three theoretical models explaining why procedural justice builds trust in organizations: the self-interest model (fair processes lead to better outcomes over time), the group value model (fair treatment signals valued membership), and the fairness heuristic model (people use procedural cues as shortcuts to decide whether to trust authority). Each model identifies a different mechanism, but all converge on the conclusion that fair processes are a primary driver of institutional trust.

[Folger & Konovsky (1989)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/folger-konovsky-1989/) demonstrated empirically that procedural justice is the stronger predictor of trust in supervisors and organizational commitment, while distributive justice predicts outcome-specific satisfaction. This means that trust is built through process, not just through delivering good results.

[Tyler & Blader (2003)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/tyler-blader-2003/) proposed the Group Engagement Model, arguing that procedures build trust and cooperation because they carry identity-relevant information. Fair treatment signals that the employee is a valued member of the group, which strengthens organizational identification and drives cooperative behavior. The relational aspects of procedural justice — respect, dignity, standing — are especially powerful as trust-building signals.

## Government

In government settings, the trust-building power of procedural fairness has been tested at multiple levels. [Herian et al. (2012)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/herian-et-al-2012/) found that citizen participation in local government budgeting in Lincoln, Nebraska, increases perceptions of procedural fairness, which in turn improves evaluations of local government — with the strongest effects among citizens who are most uncertain about their government. This suggests that fair processes build trust most where trust is lowest.

[Goldfinch, Yamamoto & Aoyagi (2023)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/goldfinch-et-al-2023/) tested the relative power of participation, performance, and process in predicting trust in Japanese local governments, finding that process perceptions are the stronger antecedent of trust — even when controlling for service delivery quality. [Grimmelikhuijsen et al. (2021)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/grimmelikhuijsen-et-al-2021/) showed experimentally that decision transparency builds trust in regulatory agencies, even when transparency reveals mistakes. Citizens give government credit for openness.

[de Fine Licht, Agerberg & Esaiasson (2022)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/de-fine-licht-et-al-2022/) extended the trust story beyond the decision point, showing that post-decision arrangements — how a local government announces, explains, and follows up after a contested decision like a school closure — have significant legitimacy-enhancing effects, independent of the pre-decision process quality.

On the driver side, several studies identify specific features that generate fairness perceptions. [Lind & Arndt (2016)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/lind-arndt-2016/) identified three primary drivers: voice (opportunity to be heard), respect (dignified treatment), and explanations (clear rationale for decisions), and applied them directly to permitting, licensing, and regulatory interactions. [Meers, Ryan & Tomlinson (2025)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/meers-et-al-2025/) demonstrated experimentally that even a small design change — adding a free-text narrative field to a government application form — significantly increases perceived fairness.

[Ruder & Woods (2020)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/ruder-woods-2020/) tested whether transparency and public participation in agency rulemaking increase perceived legitimacy, finding real but context-dependent effects. [Tummers et al. (2016)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/tummers-et-al-2016/) showed the negative case: red tape — burdensome, opaque administrative procedures — strongly reduces citizen satisfaction, demonstrating that procedural design failures actively erode trust.

[Schnaudt, Hahn & Heppner (2021)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/distributive-procedural-justice-europe-2021/) conducted a cross-national study across 27 European countries with over 30,000 respondents, finding that the type of justice that drives trust depends on the type of institution. Procedural justice is the primary driver of trust in regulatory institutions (police, courts), while distributive justice matters more for trust in representative institutions (parliament, government).

[Somuano Ventura & Takahashi (2025)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/somuano-ventura-takahashi-2025/) tested the procedural justice-trust link in Mexico, a context where institutional credibility is generally low. They found that the relationship between procedural fairness perceptions and institutional trust operates even in low-trust environments, suggesting that procedural legitimacy is not a luxury of high-functioning democracies but a viable trust-building strategy in challenging institutional contexts.

On the destructive side, corruption scandals demonstrate how quickly trust can be damaged and how persistently that damage endures. [Solé-Ollé & Sorribas-Navarro (2018)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/sole-olle-sorribas-navarro-2018/) found that while corruption *perceptions* gradually recover after local scandals in Spain, trust in local politicians remains persistently depressed — an asymmetry that underscores how much harder trust is to rebuild than to destroy.

[Beshi & Kaur (2020)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/public-trust-good-governance-2019/) modeled how governance practices predict trust in Ethiopian local government, finding that responsiveness — the degree to which government is perceived as reacting to citizen concerns — is the strongest predictor of public trust. This highlights that trust is built not just through procedural design at the point of decision, but through ongoing institutional responsiveness.

[de Fine Licht et al. (2014)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/transparency-legitimacy-experiment/) provided an important experimental finding that transparency does not automatically increase legitimacy — its effect depends on the quality of the process being revealed. When the process observed is of high quality, transparency boosts legitimacy. But when the process is of poor quality, transparency can backfire, reducing legitimacy rather than enhancing it.

[Alica & Schakel (2025)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/multilevel-government-legitimacy/) found that locating decisions at subnational levels increases acceptance of those decisions, but primarily among citizens who already prefer decentralization. This suggests that the legitimacy benefits of procedural decentralization are conditional on citizens' prior institutional preferences rather than universal.

[Hillo et al. (2024)](/procedural-legitimacy-wiki/papers/hillo-algorithmic-governance-2024/) examined perceived legitimacy in algorithmic governance, finding that both algorithmic transparency and the preservation of human discretion enhance perceived legitimacy in government decision-making. However, these effects are substantially larger among administrators than among citizens, suggesting that the procedural features that build legitimacy inside government may differ from those that build it outside.
