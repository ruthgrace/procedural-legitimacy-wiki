title: "Why Improve Procedural Legitimacy"
description: "The strategic case for investing in fair processes — from policy acceptance and regulatory compliance to organizational trust and democratic governance."
---

Why should an organization or government invest in procedural fairness? Beyond the moral case, there is a strong strategic one. Fair processes sustain voluntary compliance, build institutional trust, enable policy implementation, and reduce the costs of enforcement and conflict. This section collects research that makes the case for procedural legitimacy as a practical necessity — showing that institutions that neglect fair process pay real costs in resistance, non-compliance, litigation, and legitimacy deficits.

The papers here approach the question from multiple angles: some demonstrate that procedural legitimacy is especially critical when substantive agreement is impossible, others show that process can substitute for outcome quality in sustaining trust, and still others argue that legitimacy is a distinct dimension of institutional success that cannot be reduced to effectiveness or efficiency.

## Corporate and Organizational

[Sapienza & Korsgaard (1996)](/papers/sapienza-korsgaard-1996/) demonstrated the strategic value of procedural fairness in entrepreneur-investor relations. Entrepreneurs who shared information transparently and provided timely feedback built trust with venture capital investors, while those who hoarded information preserved short-term leverage but eroded the relationship. The paper illustrates a dilemma that applies broadly in corporate governance: transparency builds trust but surrenders control, while opacity preserves control but destroys trust. Over the long run, the trust-building strategy dominates.

[Tax, Brown & Chandrashekaran (1998)](/papers/tax-et-al-1998/) made the business case for procedural fairness in customer relationships. When companies handle complaints through fair processes — timely, accessible, respectful — customers' trust and commitment to the firm can actually *increase* relative to pre-failure levels. Poor complaint handling, by contrast, destroys customer relationships and generates negative word-of-mouth. The cost of investing in fair complaint processes is far lower than the cost of losing customers.

## Government

[Van Ryzin (2011)](/papers/van-ryzin-2011/) challenged the performance-management orthodoxy in public administration by showing that process (fairness and equity) is a consistently stronger predictor of trust in civil servants than outcomes (service delivery quality) across 33 countries. If governments want public trust, investing in fair processes may be more effective than investing in better outcomes alone — a finding that upends decades of New Public Management thinking.

[Wallner (2008)](/papers/wallner-2008/) made the case through comparative policy analysis. Alberta and Ontario pursued similar education reforms in the 1990s, but Alberta succeeded and Ontario failed — not because of policy substance, but because Alberta invested in procedural legitimacy (stakeholder engagement, transparent deliberation, gradual rollout) while Ontario imposed reforms top-down. The message: even well-designed policies fail without procedural legitimacy.

[Murphy, Tyler & Curtis (2009)](/papers/murphy-tyler-curtis-2009/) provided evidence for perhaps the strongest strategic argument: procedural justice matters *most* when people question the legitimacy of the law itself. In domains where regulations are contested — tax policy, welfare rules, environmental standards — fair procedures are the primary mechanism for sustaining voluntary compliance. When substantive agreement is absent, process is all that's left.

[Daniels & Sabin (1997)](/papers/daniels-sabin-1997/) developed the influential "accountability for reasonableness" framework for health care rationing, arguing that when there is no consensus on substantive principles for allocating scarce resources, legitimacy must be secured through fair procedures — publicity, relevance, revisability, and enforcement. This framework has been applied far beyond health care, to any domain where authorities must make consequential decisions in the absence of substantive agreement. It represents the strongest theoretical case for procedural legitimacy as a necessity rather than a luxury.

[Hayward (2002)](/papers/enhanced-local-authority-legitimacy/) examined deliberative innovations such as citizens' juries and planning tribunals for local government, showing that institutional commitment can make participatory experiments genuinely effective at building legitimacy. However, Hayward also found that these experiments can backfire when their recommendations challenge powerful interests — illustrating both the potential and the political fragility of procedural legitimacy investments.

[Marlin-Tackie et al. (2020)](/papers/fracking-energy-justice-2020/) demonstrated the strategic value of investing in fair process for controversial facility siting. In a comparison of communities negotiating fracking memoranda of understanding, the community with active procedural justice facilitation saw increased trust in local government, while communities without such facilitation did not. This provides direct evidence that the costs of building procedural legitimacy are repaid in institutional trust.

[McKee (2025)](/papers/procedural-justice-water-management-2025/) conducted a systematic review of procedural justice in water governance, highlighting how power asymmetries between state agencies and local communities undermine formal participatory mechanisms. Marginalized communities are disproportionately excluded from water management decisions, suggesting that improving procedural legitimacy requires addressing structural power imbalances, not just adding participation opportunities.

[Eneqvist et al. (2022)](/papers/municipal-experimental-governance-2021/) found that municipal experiments in governance innovation tend to prioritize output legitimacy — demonstrating that new approaches work — while neglecting input legitimacy (who gets to participate) and throughput legitimacy (how transparent and fair the process is). This creates a legitimacy deficit that undermines the very goals of experimentation, suggesting that procedural legitimacy must be designed in from the start rather than retrofitted.
