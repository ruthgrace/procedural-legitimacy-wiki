# Procedural Legitimacy Research Wiki

A research wiki exploring how people perceive the procedural legitimacy of government functions beyond the criminal justice system. While procedural justice research has traditionally focused on policing and courts, this project surveys the broader landscape — examining legitimacy perceptions across regulatory agencies, administrative bodies, public services, and other arms of government.

## About

This wiki is built with [Astro Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) and serves as a living literature review and knowledge base for research on procedural legitimacy in non-criminal-justice government contexts.

## Development

All commands are run from the root of the project:
